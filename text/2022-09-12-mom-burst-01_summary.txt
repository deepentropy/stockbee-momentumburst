## 1. Introduction to Momentum Burst

Momentum burst is presented as the central tendency of how stocks move. Instead of moving in a smooth, continuous fashion, stocks often move in short, powerful bursts of momentum. These bursts are the key opportunity that traders can use to make substantial profits in a short period.

The lesson emphasizes that understanding and exploiting this momentum burst behavior can be a highly effective way to make money in the stock market. The video series is dedicated to showing how to profit from these bursts.

## 2. Core Characteristics of Momentum Bursts

### 2.1 Duration of the Move

- Momentum bursts typically last **3 to 5 trading days**.  
- Within this short window, the bulk of the move occurs; the stock makes a significant advance (or decline) in that brief period.

### 2.2 Typical Percentage and Dollar Moves

For most stocks:

- In **3 to 5 days**, stocks commonly move **8% to 40%**.

For higher-priced stocks:

- In the same **3 to 5 day** window, they can move **$50 to $300** per share.

These ranges are repeatedly observed in the examples and are described as a common, recurring phenomenon in the market.

### 2.3 Occurrence in Different Types of Stocks

- Momentum bursts occur in **lower-priced**, **mid-priced**, and **high-priced** stocks.  
- They are not limited to any single sector or price range.  
- The same burst behavior is seen on both the **upside** (rallies) and the **downside** (sharp declines).

## 3. Examples of Momentum Bursts

The instructor uses TC2000 charting software to visually demonstrate multiple instances of momentum bursts. While the exact tickers (except a few) are not all named, the behavior is consistent.

### 3.1 Examples in Lower- and Mid-Priced Stocks

Several unnamed stocks are shown with the following characteristics:

- A **sudden burst of momentum** followed by a **3 to 5 day** move.
- Example moves mentioned:
  - A stock making a **121%** move in **3 to 5 days**.
  - Another stock making a **22%** move in **3 to 5 days**.
  - A stock making a **104%** move in **3 to 5 days**.
  - A stock making a **17%** move in **3 to 5 days**.
  - A stock making an **8% to 12%** move in **3 to 5 days**.
  - Another stock making an **8% to 20%** move in **3 to 5 days**.

Specific example:

- **EPRON** (as mentioned in the transcript):
  - Recently had a **big move**.
  - Displayed a clear **burst of momentum**.
  - Made a **60%** move in a short burst.

These examples reinforce the idea that such bursts are frequent and can be found by scanning through random stocks.

### 3.2 Examples in High-Priced Stocks

The same momentum burst behavior is shown in high-priced stocks:

- **AutoZone (AZO)**:
  - Exhibited a **3-day momentum burst**.
  - Moved around **$100** in those **3 days**.

- **Booking (BKNG)**:
  - Had a **3-day momentum burst**.
  - Moved about **$58** in that period.

- **Tesla (TSLA)**:
  - When it moves, it tends to move in **3 to 5 day** momentum bursts.
  - Example given:
    - A **3–4 day** momentum burst.
    - Resulted in about a **$35 move** or **13%** move.

These examples show that even expensive stocks follow the same burst pattern, just expressed in larger dollar amounts.

### 3.3 Momentum Bursts on the Downside

Momentum bursts also occur in downward moves:

- In the Booking example:
  - A **momentum burst to the downside** is highlighted.
  - The stock made a **$92** move down in a short burst.

This confirms that the same 3–5 day burst structure applies to both rallies and sharp declines, offering opportunities for both long and short strategies.

## 4. Practical Importance for Traders

- The instructor emphasizes that this **3–5 day momentum burst** is a **very common phenomenon** in the market.
- Because it repeats **again and again**, traders can **systematically exploit** it.
- By focusing on these bursts, traders can:
  - Capture **8–40%** moves in lower/mid-priced stocks.
  - Capture **$50–$300** moves in higher-priced stocks.
  - Do so within a **short time frame** (3–5 days), which is attractive for active traders and day/swing traders.

The core message: understanding and trading momentum bursts can be a powerful, repeatable edge.

## 5. Need for Deeper Understanding

The current lesson introduces the concept and shows examples. The instructor stresses that **profiting consistently** from momentum bursts requires more detailed knowledge.

### 5.1 Studying the Nature of Momentum Bursts

To use this phenomenon effectively, traders must:

- Develop a **deeper understanding** of how momentum bursts form and unfold.
- Study many examples of bursts to internalize:
  - How they start.
  - How they progress over the 3–5 day window.
  - How they end.

The instructor encourages studying charts to see this pattern repeatedly.

### 5.2 First Day of the Momentum Burst

A key focus for future lessons:

- **What happens on the first day of the momentum burst?**
- Understanding the **first day’s characteristics** is crucial because:
  - It can help identify a burst **early**.
  - It allows traders to **enter** near the beginning of the move.
  - It forms the basis for a **rule-based trading method**.

The instructor explicitly states that the next part will examine the **nature of the first day** of a momentum burst.

### 5.3 Building a Trading Method Around Momentum Bursts

The ultimate goal is to translate this understanding into a **concrete trading method**:

- Use knowledge of:
  - The **3–5 day structure**.
  - The **typical size** of moves.
  - The **first day’s behavior**.
- To create:
  - **Entry rules** (when a burst is starting).
  - **Exit rules** (when the burst is likely ending).
  - A systematic way to **profit from momentum bursts** repeatedly.

The instructor states that this understanding will be used to **create a trading method** specifically designed to exploit momentum bursts.

## 6. Next Steps in the Lesson Series

- This lesson serves as an **introduction** to the concept of momentum bursts and demonstrates that:
  - They are common.
  - They are powerful.
  - They occur in all price ranges and in both directions.

- In the **next part** of the series, the instructor will:
  - Analyze the **nature of momentum bursts** in more detail.
  - Focus on **what happens on the first day** of a burst.
  - Show **how to use that understanding** to build a **practical trading method** for profiting from these 3–5 day moves.
