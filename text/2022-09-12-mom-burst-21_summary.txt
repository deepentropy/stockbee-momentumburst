## 1. Overview of the Tool Link Setup

The “tool link” setup is a specific breakout pattern with clearly defined conditions. It focuses on:

- A strong, linear first leg of the move (persistent buying).
- A compact, orderly consolidation.
- A clean breakout that meets strict criteria.

The goal is to identify only the highest-quality instances of this pattern to improve trading success.

---

## 2. Importance of Studying Historical Examples

To recognize and trade the tool link setup effectively in real time, you must:

- Study many past examples of tool link setups.
- Review charts where the setup has already played out.
- Train your eye so that, when running scans, you can instantly recognize a valid tool link pattern.

The more examples you study, the easier it becomes to spot the setup quickly and accurately during live trading.

## 3. Core Conditions of a High-Quality Tool Link Setup

A valid tool link setup must meet several specific conditions. The example discussed in the lesson satisfies all of them.

### 3.1. Not Up Two Days in a Row

- The stock should **not** be up two days in a row going into the breakout.
- This means the immediate pre-breakout action is not an extended, multi-day run.
- Avoid setups where the stock has been up multiple days consecutively before the breakout; those tend to be lower quality.

### 3.2. Linearity and Persistent Buying

- The first leg of the move should show **linearity**:
  - Price moves in a relatively straight, consistent upward fashion.
  - There is **persistent buying** rather than erratic, choppy movement.
- A linear first leg indicates strong, steady demand and a cleaner trend.

### 3.3. Narrow or Negative Day Before Breakout

- The day immediately prior to the breakout should be:
  - A **narrow range day**, or  
  - A **negative day** (down day).
- This narrow or negative day occurs **right before** the breakout and is a key characteristic of the setup.
- It often reflects a brief pause or shakeout before the next leg higher.

### 3.4. Consolidation Quality

The consolidation after the first leg and before the breakout must be:

- **Orderly** and **compact**:
  - Price action is controlled, not wild or erratic.
  - No big, random swings.
- **Just up four days** in total during the consolidation phase:
  - The consolidation is not overly extended in time or number of up days.
- The consolidation should visually appear tight and well-structured, not loose or choppy.

### 3.5. Volume Behavior During Consolidation

- During the consolidation:
  - There should be **no big volume spikes**.
- Quiet volume in consolidation suggests:
  - No heavy distribution.
  - No abnormal activity that might signal weakness or instability.

### 3.6. No 4% Breakdown

- Throughout the consolidation, there should be **no 4% breakdown**:
  - The stock should not drop 4% or more from recent levels during this phase.
- A 4% breakdown would violate the setup and indicate a failure or breakdown of the pattern.

### 3.7. Breakout Day Characteristics

On the breakout day itself:

- The stock should be **breaking out** of the consolidation.
- It should be **closing near the high of the day**.
- This strong close confirms buying strength and validates the breakout.

When all these conditions are present, the setup qualifies as a high-quality tool link pattern.

## 4. Example Walkthrough Using TC2000

Using TC2000, the lesson walks through a specific example:

- On the chosen day:
  - The first leg showed **linearity** and **persistent buying**.
  - The stock was **not up two days in a row** before the breakout.
  - The day before the breakout was a **narrow or negative day**.
  - The **consolidation** was:
    - Very **orderly** and **compact**.
    - **Just up four days**.
    - Without **big volume** spikes.
    - Without any **4% breakdown**.
  - On the breakout day, the stock **broke out** and **closed near the high**.

This example is presented as a model of what a **good tool link setup** should look like.

---

## 5. Selectivity and Probability of Success

- If you **focus only** on setups that meet **every** tool link condition:
  - Your **probability of success** increases significantly.
- Even if you find only a limited number of such setups in a year:
  - Those few high-quality trades can be enough to produce strong results.
- The emphasis is on **quality over quantity**:
  - Avoid marginal or partial setups.
  - Trade only the cleanest, highest-probability patterns.

---

## 6. Common Mistake: Choppy, Extended Setups

A key warning in the lesson:

- Avoid **very choppy setups**.
- Avoid setups where the stock is **up three days in a row** going into the breakout.
  - These are less likely to work well.
- Choppy, extended pre-breakout action often leads to failed breakouts or poor follow-through.

By strictly filtering out these lower-quality patterns and trading only the clean, textbook tool link setups, you align your trading with higher-probability opportunities.
