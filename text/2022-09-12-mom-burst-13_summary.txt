## 1. Overview of Pradeep Bond’s Trading Approach

Pradeep Bond’s day trading approach is centered on **momentum burst** setups. All the methods he trades are variations of this same underlying idea. He focuses on a small set of repeatable, rule-based setups that can be used **every day** to find trading opportunities and generate consistent profits.

## 2. Core Concept: Momentum Burst

**Momentum burst** is the foundational concept behind all the methods discussed. While this segment does not define it in detail, the key idea is:

- Look for **sudden, strong moves** in a stock’s price.
- These moves represent a **burst of momentum** that can be exploited for short-term trading.
- Every method (4% breakout, dollar breakout, low threshold breakout, and combination scan) is simply a different way to **detect and trade** these bursts.

## 3. Main Trading Methods

All methods below are **momentum burst–based setups**. They differ mainly in how they define and detect the burst.

### 3.1. 4% Breakout

- A trading method based on a **percentage move** in price.  
- A stock qualifies when it makes a **4% breakout**, signaling a momentum burst.  
- This is one of the primary setups Pradeep trades.

### 3.2. Dollar Breakout

- A trading method based on an **absolute dollar move** in price.  
- Instead of a percentage, it looks for a **specific dollar amount** of breakout to indicate momentum.  
- Also a core method in his trading.

### 3.3. Combination Scan (4% + Dollar Breakout)

- A method that **combines both 4% breakout and dollar breakout criteria**.  
- Often referred to as the **combination scan**.  
- It looks for stocks that meet **both** the percentage and dollar breakout thresholds, aiming to capture strong, high-quality momentum bursts.

### 3.4. Low Threshold Breakout

- A separate setup previously used by Pradeep, also based on **momentum burst**.  
- Called **low threshold breakout**, implying it uses **lower or more sensitive thresholds** to detect bursts.  
- It is mentioned as part of his toolkit, though the focus in this lesson is on the other three methods and their combination.

## 4. Comparative Advantages of Each Method

- Each method—4% breakout, dollar breakout, low threshold breakout, and the combination scan—has **its own advantages**.  
- The lesson notes that:
  - They are all valid ways to trade momentum bursts.
  - Some may be better suited to certain market conditions or trader preferences than others.
- Detailed comparison of these advantages is reserved for future videos, where each method will be covered individually.

## 5. Practical Application: Using the Methods to Find Daily Trades

Pradeep’s objective is to show how a trader can:

- Use **4% breakout**, **dollar breakout**, or the **combination scan**  
- To **find trades every day**  
- And **make money on an ongoing basis**.

The emphasis is on:

- **Daily, repeatable scanning** for momentum bursts using these setups.  
- Turning these scans into **consistent, actionable trades**.

## 6. Future Lessons and Deeper Method Details

Pradeep indicates that this is an **introductory overview**:

- He will go into **details of each method** in a **series of videos**.  
- Each method (4% breakout, dollar breakout, combination scan, and low threshold breakout) will be taken **one at a time**.  
- He will demonstrate **how to use each setup** to:
  - Identify qualifying stocks,
  - Execute trades,
  - And apply the methods consistently for ongoing profits.

This lesson establishes the **framework and terminology**; the specific rules, examples, and deeper technical details are to follow in subsequent lessons.
