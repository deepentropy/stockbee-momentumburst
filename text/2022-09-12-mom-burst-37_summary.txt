## 1. Introduction: Using Stops Efficiently

Pradeep explains how to automate stop placement in TC2000 so you don’t have to manually calculate stops for each trade. The goal is to:

- Place stops at either:
  - The low of the day, or  
  - Half of the day’s range above the open  
- Have these stop levels displayed automatically on your chart and/or in your watchlist.
- Speed up execution so that when you see a breakout, you immediately know where to place your stop.

## 2. Stop Placement Concepts

### 2.1 Stop at Low of the Day

- One common stop placement is at the **low of the day’s bar**.
- Example: If the day’s low is **27.57**, then:
  - Stop = 27.57  
- In TC2000, this is referred to as **Bar Low**.

### 2.2 Stop at Half of the Day’s Range

- Another approach is to place the stop at **half of the day’s range** above the open.
- The formula uses:
  - O = Opening price  
  - C = Closing price (or current price for the day’s bar)  
- Half of the day’s range is calculated as:
  - (C − O) / 2  
- The stop is then:
  - Stop = O + (C − O) / 2  
- Example:
  - If half of the day’s range works out to **2.17**, and the open is such that this gives a stop at **28.63**, then:
    - Stop (half range) = 28.63  

This gives you a stop that is **higher than the low of the day**, providing a tighter risk level than using the absolute low.

## 3. Implementing Stops in TC2000 (Top Bar / Chart Template)

Pradeep shows how to add these stop values to the **top bar of your chart template** in TC2000 so they are always visible.

### 3.1 Adding “Low of the Day” (Bar Low) to the Top Bar

1. **Open your chart in TC2000** with your usual template.  
2. **Left-click on the chart template toolbar** and select **“Edit Toolbar”**.  
3. A configuration window opens.  
4. Scroll to the **end of the toolbar items**.  
5. Look for **“Bar Low”** in the available items:
   - This represents the **low of the current bar (day)**.  
6. Select **Bar Low** and customize:
   - Increase font size if desired.  
   - Make it bold or italics if you want.  
   - Change the text color (e.g., light blue).  
   - Add a prefix such as **“Stop”** so it displays like:  
     - Stop 27.57  
7. Click **Add** (or equivalent) and then **OK**.  

Now, on your chart’s top bar, you will see something like:

- **Stop 27.57** (which is the low of the day for that stock).

This gives you an automatic **stop at low of the day**.

### 3.2 Creating a Custom Formula for “Half of the Day’s Range”

To place a stop at half of the day’s range, you first create a custom indicator formula.

1. In TC2000, go to **New → Indicator Formula** (or similar menu: “Add Indicator Formula”).  
2. In the formula editor, write the formula for half of the day’s range added to the open:

   - **Formula:**
     ```text
     O + (C - O) / 2
     ```

   - Explanation:
     - O = Opening price  
     - C = Closing price  
     - (C − O) / 2 = half of the day’s range  
     - O + (C − O) / 2 = price level at half the day’s range above the open  

3. Give this formula a name, for example:
   - **StopHalf** (Pradeep uses something like “stop half” to distinguish it).  
4. Click **OK** to save the formula.  
5. Select any placeholder plot if TC2000 asks, then close the window.  

Now this custom formula is stored in your **library** under **“My Items”** or **“My Formulas”**.

---

### 3.3 Adding the “Half Range Stop” to the Top Bar

Once the custom formula is created:

1. Go again to your chart and **left-click → Edit Toolbar**.  
2. Scroll to the **end** of the toolbar items.  
3. Look for your custom formula under:
   - **Columns and Reports / Indicator and Chart Plots / My Items / My Formulas**  
   - Find **StopHalf** (or the name you used).  
4. Select **StopHalf** and add it to the toolbar.  
5. Customize its appearance:
   - Change text color if desired.  
   - It will typically display with its name as a prefix (e.g., “StopHalf 28.63”).  
   - If needed, manually add a prefix like **“Stop Half”** so it shows clearly:
     - Stop Half 28.63  
6. Arrange the order:
   - Click on the item and use the move arrows to place it **next to the “Stop” (Bar Low)** item.  
   - For example:
     - Stop 27.57 | Stop Half 28.63  

7. Click **OK** to save.

Now, on your chart’s top bar, you will see both:

- **Stop 27.57** (low of the day)  
- **Stop Half 28.63** (half of the day’s range stop)

This allows you to instantly know both possible stop levels when you look at a breakout.

## 4. Implementing Stops in TC2000 (Watchlist Columns)

Pradeep also shows how to add these stop values as **columns in your watchlist**, using the same logic.

### 4.1 Adding a “Low of the Day” Column

1. In your watchlist, **insert a new column**:
   - Right-click on the column header area → **Insert Column → Value Column**.  
2. In the value selection, look for:
   - **Low** or **Bar Low** (depending on TC2000’s naming).  
3. Select **Low** as the column value.  
4. This column will now show the **low of the day** for each stock.  
5. To make it clear that this is your stop level:
   - Right-click the column header → **Properties** → rename it to **“Stop”**.  

Example:
- For stock **ECH**, the low of the day is **27.57**, so the column will show:
  - Stop = 27.57  

This matches the stop at low of the day shown on the chart.

---

### 4.2 Adding a “Half Range Stop” Column

Since you already created the **StopHalf** formula:

1. In the watchlist, **insert another column**:
   - Insert Column → Value Column.  
2. In the value selection, go to:
   - **My Items / My Formulas** and find **StopHalf** (or your chosen name).  
3. Select **StopHalf** as the column value.  
4. The column will now show the **half-range stop** for each stock.

Example:
- For stock **ECH**, the half-range stop is **28.63**, so the column will show:
  - StopHalf = 28.63  

This value will match what you see on the chart’s top bar for the same stock.

Pradeep notes that he **prefers having these values on the chart top bar**, as it’s easier to see and use when entering trades, but the column method is also available and useful.

## 5. Trading Process Benefit: Organize Like Crazy Around Your Setup

Key psychological and process advice from Pradeep:

- **“Organize like crazy around your setup.”**  
  - Pre-build all the tools and calculations you need (like automatic stops) into your platform.  
  - When a breakout appears, you should:
    - Immediately know where to enter.  
    - Immediately know where to place your stop (low of day or half-range).  
- By having:
  - **Stop at low of day** and  
  - **Stop at half of the day’s range**  
  automatically displayed:
  - You avoid manual calculations.  
  - You don’t need a calculator or to “figure it out” in real time.  
  - Your decision-making becomes faster and more consistent.  

This organization reduces friction and hesitation, allowing you to execute your trading plan quickly and systematically whenever you see a valid breakout.
