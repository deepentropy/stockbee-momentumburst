## 1. Overview: 4% Breakout Win Rate and Market Phases

The win rate of the 4% breakout method is heavily dependent on the overall market environment. The same setup can have a very high win rate in certain phases and a poor win rate in others. To trade 4% breakouts successfully, you must:

- Identify when the market is favorable for breakouts.  
- Avoid trading breakouts during unfavorable phases.  
- Use objective tools (like the Market Monitor) to filter trades.

## 2. The Market Monitor and Primary Indicator

### 2.1. Definition of the Primary Indicator

The **primary indicator** in the Market Monitor is based on the **number of stocks up 25% or more in a month or in a quarter**. It is color-coded:

- **Green**: Indicates a bullish environment with many stocks making 25%+ moves in a quarter.  
- **Red**: Indicates a bearish or weak environment with fewer strong movers.

This indicator reflects whether money is flowing into the market or not.

### 2.2. Bullish Primary Indicator and High Win Rate

4% breakouts work best when:

- The **primary indicator is green** (bullish).  
- The primary indicator is **about to turn bullish after an extremely oversold level**.  
- There is a **continuous stretch of green readings** on the Market Monitor.  
- There are **no 300+ down days** in the market during that period.

In such conditions:

- Money is flowing into the market.  
- Many stocks are making strong moves (25%+ in a quarter).  
- Breakouts tend to follow through, and win rates are high.  

For many years, the speaker traded these breakouts **only when the primary indicator was bullish**.

### 2.3. Bearish Primary Indicator and Low Win Rate

When the primary indicator is **red**:

- Selling pressure is present.  
- Money is not flowing into the market in a sustained way.  
- 4% breakouts have a **much lower win rate**.

Continuing to buy breakouts in this environment leads to:

- Frequent stop-outs.  
- A series of losing trades.

Therefore, it is **critical to avoid trading 4% breakouts when the primary indicator is red**.

## 3. Money Flow and Market Phases

### 3.1. When Money Flows Into the Market

When money is flowing into the market:

- Many stocks make **25%+ moves in a quarter**.  
- The Market Monitor shows **green** on the primary indicator.  
- You may experience periods where **almost every breakout you buy works**.

These are the periods you want to be actively trading 4% breakouts.

### 3.2. Distribution and 300+ Down Days

When **distribution** starts:

- You see **300+ down days** (300 or more stocks down significantly in a day).  
- The Market Monitor begins to show signs of selling pressure.  
- The win rate on 4% breakouts **drops suddenly**.

Key points:

- The appearance of **300+ down days** is a warning sign.  
- Once these days start appearing, you should expect **lower breakout success**.  
- Avoid or reduce breakout trading during such periods.

## 4. Timing 4% Breakouts Within the Market Cycle

### 4.1. Early vs. Late Stages of a Bull Market

In the **later stages of a bull market**:

- Most leading stocks have already made big moves.  
- Many stocks are on their **third, fourth, or fifth leg** of an advance.  
- Breakouts may still look technically attractive (tight consolidations, clean patterns) but are **late in the move**.

### 4.2. Young Breakouts vs. Late-Stage Breakouts

- **Young breakouts** (early in a stock’s move) tend to work better.  
- **Late-stage breakouts** (after multiple prior legs) are more likely to **fail**, especially when the overall market is tiring.

Objective:

- **Proactively avoid periods** when breakouts are likely to fail, especially late in the bull cycle when many stocks are extended.

---

## 5. The “20+ Daily” Study (Up 20% in 5 Days)

### 5.1. Extremely Bullish Readings and Peak Momentum

The **“20+ daily” study** (referred to as “study 20 plus daily”) tracks:

- The number of stocks that are **up 20% or more in 5 days**.

When this study is **extremely bullish**:

- You may see **100–200 stocks** showing up as **up 20%+ in 5 days**.  
- This indicates **peak momentum** in the market.  
- At such times, **4% breakouts stop working well**.

Interpretation:

- A reading around **200 stocks up 20% in 5 days** suggests that:  
  - “Everything that has to go up has gone up in a short period.”  
  - The market is **overheated**, and new breakouts are more likely to fail.

### 5.2. Low Readings and Better Breakout Conditions

When the “20+ daily” readings are **low**:

- Momentum is not at a blow-off peak.  
- Conditions are more favorable for **new breakouts**.

A particularly good environment:

- **Low “20+ daily” readings** combined with a **300+ down day** (a washout).  
- Buying breakouts after such a washout and low momentum reading tends to work **better**.

## 6. Federal Reserve Policy and Breakout Performance

### 6.1. Fed Support and Extended Breakout-Friendly Periods

When the **Federal Reserve is supporting the market**, for example:

- Through **quantitative easing** or  
- Other actions that **inject money into the market**,

then:

- A **continuous flow of money** comes into the market.  
- You can get **long stretches** (8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, even 18 months) where **breakouts continue to work** consistently.

During such periods:

- 4% breakouts can have **sustained high win rates**.

### 6.2. Fed Tightening and Fading Breakouts

When the Fed:

- **Changes its stance**,  
- **Reduces money supply**, or  
- Stops supporting the market,

then:

- Breakouts tend to **fade** more often.  
- The environment becomes less favorable for momentum and breakout strategies.

Understanding Fed policy helps you gauge whether you are in a **prolonged breakout-friendly phase** or a **more difficult environment**.

## 7. Practical Use of Filters to Improve Win Rate

### 7.1. Using Market Monitor as a Filter

To control and improve your win rate:

- Use a **filter** before taking 4% breakout trades.  
- In this method, the main filter is the **Market Monitor**, especially the **primary indicator**.

The filter should answer:

- **Is money flowing into the market?**  
- **Is the environment supportive of momentum?**

If the answer is **no**, you should **avoid or drastically reduce** breakout trading.

### 7.2. Adjusting Exposure and Selectivity

When warning signs appear (e.g., 300+ down days, red primary indicator, peak “20+ daily” readings):

- Assume there is “something in the water” (danger in the environment).  
- **Reduce your exposure**:  
  - Do not take every breakout.  
  - Become **more stringent** in stock selection.  
  - Tighten your criteria for entries and risk.

When conditions are favorable (green primary indicator, no heavy distribution, supportive Fed):

- You can be **more active** in taking breakouts.  

### 7.3. Profit-Taking and Giving Trades Room

Your profit-taking and trade management should also adapt to the market phase:

- When there is **a lot of buying coming in** and conditions are strong:  
  - If you **take profits too early**, you will **leave a lot of money on the table**.  
  - You should **give trades more room to run**.

- When conditions are deteriorating (distribution, red indicators):  
  - You should be **more cautious**,  
  - Avoid giving trades too much room,  
  - And be quicker to **reduce exposure**.

## 8. Conditions When 4% Breakouts Should Be Avoided

### 8.1. Bearish Markets

4% breakouts should be **avoided in bearish markets**:

- When the primary indicator is **red**.  
- When there is clear **selling pressure** and **distribution**.  
- When the overall trend and breadth are negative.

Trading breakouts in such conditions leads to:

- Frequent stop-outs.  
- Poor overall performance.

### 8.2. Negative Market Breadth

Breakouts should also be avoided when **market breadth is negative**:

- Breadth refers to how many stocks are participating in the move.  
- Negative breadth (many stocks declining, few advancing) is a poor environment for breakouts.

Combining breadth with the Market Monitor:

- If breadth is negative and the primary indicator is not supportive, **do not trade 4% breakouts**.

## 9. Summary of Key Rules for 4% Breakout Success

- **Trade 4% breakouts primarily when the primary indicator is green** and money is clearly flowing into the market.  
- **Avoid trading breakouts when the primary indicator is red** or during obvious distribution phases.  
- **Watch for 300+ down days**: they signal distribution and a likely drop in breakout win rate.  
- Use the **“20+ daily” study**:  
  - Extremely high readings (100–200 stocks up 20% in 5 days) = **peak momentum**, breakouts often stop working.  
  - Low readings, especially after a 300+ down day, = **better breakout opportunities**.  
- Recognize **late-stage bull markets**: many stocks on their 3rd–5th leg; late breakouts often fail.  
- Understand **Fed policy**:  
  - Fed support (QE, liquidity) can create long periods where breakouts work very well.  
  - Fed tightening reduces breakout success.  
- Use the **Market Monitor as a filter** to decide when to trade and when to stand aside.  
- **Adjust exposure and profit-taking** based on the phase:  
  - Strong, supportive markets: allow trades to run; don’t take profits too early.  
  - Weak or deteriorating markets: be selective, reduce exposure, and avoid most breakouts.  
- **Avoid breakouts in bearish markets and during negative breadth** to maintain a high win rate with the 4% breakout method.
