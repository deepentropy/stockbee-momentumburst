 Let's look at another example of tool inch to get this into your brain so that this is a pattern recognition game. Instantly as soon as you see a good breakout you should be able to select a good breakout and that is the skill in trading this momentum burst kind of setup. So here I am again going to show you a setup which met all the conditions of tool inch and that's the kind of setup you should be always focusing or everyday you should try and look for setups like this.

So you have the first leg of the breakout then you had a consolidation right. The consolidation yes you had a negative day but you didn't have 4% breakdown the volume was not high. So and then it had a narrower negative day prior to the breakout to 0% day to negative day and then it is breaking out stock is closing near high. So look for setups which meet these kind of criteria and they look like this. So look for setups which meet these kind of criteria and they look like this.
