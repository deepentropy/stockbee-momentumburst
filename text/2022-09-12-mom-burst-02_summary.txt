## 1. Introduction to Momentum Burst (Part 2 Focus)

This lesson is Part 2 of a series on momentum bursts.  
The focus here is specifically on:

- What starts a momentum burst.
- How the first day of a momentum burst looks on a chart.
- How to recognize this “start” using range expansion or a large candle.

The goal is to understand this pattern so it can be identified in real stocks in real time.


## 2. Definition of Range Expansion and Momentum Burst

**Momentum Burst:**  
A short-term, powerful move in a stock, typically lasting about 3–5 days (sometimes a bit longer), where the stock moves strongly in one direction.

**Range Expansion (Start of Momentum Burst):**

- A day where the stock’s price movement (the daily bar or candle) is significantly larger than recent days.
- Often appears after the stock has:
  - Been going sideways, or  
  - Been going down, or  
  - Been making only minor moves.
- This large bar or big candle is the **trigger** that starts the momentum burst.

The **magnitude** of that first day is important. It should be clearly larger than the prior 3–4 days, indicating a real burst of momentum.


## 3. Characteristics of the First Day of a Momentum Burst

Key features of the first day:

- **Large Candle / Big Bar:**  
  The daily bar is visibly bigger than the bars of the last 3–4 days.

- **Range Expansion:**  
  The day’s range (high–low) and/or percentage move is much larger than recent days.

- **Directional Signal:**  
  - If the range expansion is **positive** (up day), it often signals a move **up** for the next 3–5 days.  
  - If the range expansion is **negative** (down day), it often signals a move **down** for the next 3–5 days.

- **Context:**  
  The stock is usually:
  - Not making big moves just before this day.
  - Either drifting down, pulling back, or moving sideways.

This first large bar is what kicks off the momentum burst phase.


## 4. Long-Side Examples of Range Expansion

These examples illustrate how a range expansion day starts a momentum burst to the upside.

### 4.1 Beyond Meat (BYND) – 7% Range Expansion Leading to 28% Move

- Before the move:
  - The stock was not making a big move.
  - It had been going down for 3–4 days.
- Range expansion day:
  - The stock moved up about **7%** in a single day.
  - This day’s bar was clearly larger than the prior days.
- After the range expansion:
  - For the next **3–5 days**, the stock kept going up.
  - The total move from that start was about **28%**.
- Interpretation:
  - This 7% day was the **start of a momentum burst**.

### 4.2 Beyond Meat – 13% Range Expansion Leading to 10% Move

- Before the move:
  - The stock was not making a big move.
  - It was having a **minor pullback**.
- Range expansion day:
  - A big day compared to the last 3–4 days.
  - The stock was up about **13%**.
- After the range expansion:
  - This started another momentum burst.
  - Over the next **3 days**, the stock moved about **10%**.
- Interpretation:
  - Again, the large bar (13% up) marked the **start of a new momentum burst**.

### 4.3 Large Range Expansion Leading to 199% Move

- Setup:
  - The stock had relatively small bars before the move.
- Range expansion day:
  - A big day compared to all other recent days.
  - Clear range expansion / large candle.
- After the range expansion:
  - From that day, the stock entered a momentum phase.
  - The stock ultimately made a move of about **199%**.
- Interpretation:
  - The big bar was the **start of a very powerful momentum burst**.

### 4.4 42% Range Expansion Leading to 102% Move in 7 Days

- Before the move:
  - The stock was not going up for 3–4 days.
  - It was essentially flat or quiet.
- Range expansion day:
  - A very clear, large range expansion.
  - The stock was up about **42%** in one day.
- After the range expansion:
  - This kicked off a momentum phase.
  - Over the next **7 days**, the stock kept going up.
  - The total move in those 7 days was about **102%**.
- Interpretation:
  - A very strong example of a range expansion starting a multi-day momentum burst.

### 4.5 Additional Range Expansion Leading to 102% Move in 5–6 Days

- Another example on the same stock:
  - Again, a clear momentum burst started by a big bar.
- Range expansion day:
  - A large bar indicating strong momentum.
- After the range expansion:
  - In about **5–6 days**, the stock made a move of about **102%**.
- Interpretation:
  - Repeated pattern: big bar → 3–7 day momentum burst.

### 4.6 Smaller 4.66% Range Expansion and Subsequent Move

- Range expansion day:
  - This day’s bar was bigger than any of the recent days.
  - The stock was up about **4.66%**.
- After the range expansion:
  - The stock kept going up from that point.
- Additional observations:
  - There were other range expansions on the same stock:
    - Some led to good moves.
    - One example: a range expansion that **did not** lead to much of a move.
- Interpretation:
  - Even a relatively smaller percentage move (4.66%) can be a range expansion if it is clearly larger than the prior 3–4 days.
  - Not every range expansion leads to a big follow-through, but many do.


## 5. Range Expansion on the Short Side

Range expansion works similarly on the downside: a large negative bar can start a downward momentum burst.

### 5.1 Nvidia – Downside Range Expansion Leading to 16% Decline

- Range expansion day:
  - A **big range expansion to the downside**.
  - The bar was much larger than recent bars.
- After the range expansion:
  - Over the next **3–5 days**, the stock went down about **16%**.
- Interpretation:
  - A large negative bar signaled a momentum burst **down**.

### 5.2 Nvidia – Upside Range Expansion and Subsequent Rally

- Range expansion day:
  - A **range expansion to the upside**.
  - The bar was bigger than the bars in the last 3–4 days.
- After the range expansion:
  - From that day, the stock kept going up for the next **3–5 days**.
- Interpretation:
  - The direction of the range expansion (up or down) indicates the likely direction of the next 3–5 days.


## 6. General Rules and Behavior of Range Expansion

From all the examples, the following general behavior emerges:

1. **Range Expansion = Start of Momentum Burst**
   - At the beginning of any momentum burst (long or short), you typically see a **large range expansion bar**.
   - This bar is larger than the prior 3–4 days’ bars.

2. **Direction of Move**
   - Positive range expansion (big up day) → stock tends to move **up** for the next 3–5 days.
   - Negative range expansion (big down day) → stock tends to move **down** for the next 3–5 days.

3. **Time Frame of the Burst**
   - The momentum burst typically lasts about **3–5 days**.
   - In some examples, the move extended to **7 days**.

4. **Visual Clarity**
   - On a chart, the range expansion day stands out:
     - The candle is visibly larger than recent candles.
     - It is a clear “big bar” relative to the last 3–4 days.

5. **Applies to Both Sides**
   - The concept works on:
     - The **long side** (upside bursts).
     - The **short side** (downside bursts).


## 7. Reliability, Limitations, and Practical Implications

- **Powerful but Not Perfect**
  - Range expansion is described as a **powerful signal**.
  - It tells you that the stock is likely to go up or down in the direction of the range expansion for the next 3–5 days.
  - However:
    - **Not every range expansion will have follow-through.**
    - Some range expansions will fail or lead to only small moves.

- **Frequency and Usefulness**
  - Enough range expansions in a year **do** have follow-through to make this a useful and powerful concept for traders.
  - The key is to recognize:
    - The **start** of the move (the big bar).
    - The **direction** indicated by that bar.

- **Practical Takeaway**
  - At the beginning of any momentum burst, look for:
    - A **large range expansion bar** compared to the last 3–4 days.
  - Use the direction of that bar (up or down) to anticipate:
    - A **3–5 day move** in the same direction.
  - Understand that:
    - Range expansion is a **signal**, not a guarantee.
    - It is most valuable because a significant number of these signals lead to strong, tradable momentum bursts.
