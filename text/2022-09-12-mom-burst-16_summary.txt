## 1. Introduction to the 4% Scan

The 4% scan is a basic, systematic way to find stocks that move sharply in a single day, either up (breakout) or down (breakdown), with confirming volume. The lesson focuses on how to set up these scans in TC2000 so you can consistently identify such candidates.

## 2. Platform Setup: Using TC2000

All instructions are demonstrated using TC2000. The process involves:

- Creating a **combo list** that defines which stocks will be scanned.
- Writing a **formula** that captures the 4% move and volume conditions.
- Applying optional **filters** (such as minimum price) to refine the results.

## 3. Creating the 4% Breakout (Bullish) Scan

### 3.1. Creating a New Combo List

1. In TC2000, go to **New**.  
2. Select **Open Combo List**.  
3. Name the list: **“4% breakout bullish”**.

This combo list will be the container for your bullish 4% breakout scan.

### 3.2. Defining the Source Universe (Lists to Scan)

Within this new combo list, specify what types of securities you want to scan:

- Add **US stocks**.  
- Add **American Depository Receipts (ADRs)**.  
- Add **ETFs**.

These combined lists form the **source list** that the scan will run on.

### 3.3. Writing the 4% Breakout Formula

Add a **condition** to the combo list by writing a formula:

Name the condition: **“4% breakout bullish”**.

Formula logic:

- Price up at least 4% from yesterday:
  - `C / C1 >= 1.04`  
  (Today’s close divided by yesterday’s close is at least 1.04.)

- Today’s volume greater than yesterday’s volume:
  - `V / V1`  
  (Used as a condition that today’s volume is higher than yesterday’s.)

- Minimum absolute volume:
  - `V >= 100000`  
  (Today’s volume is at least 100,000 shares.)

Combined, this identifies stocks that are up 4% or more on higher volume, with a minimum liquidity threshold.

### 3.4. Applying and Viewing Results

- After entering the formula, run the scan on the defined source list.  
- You will see a set of results (example given: **127 stocks**).  
- To organize the display, use **Move Window → Tab Here** to place this result list as a tab labeled **“4% breakout bullish”**.

This gives you a dedicated tab showing all current 4% bullish breakouts.

## 4. Creating the 4% Breakdown (Bearish) Scan

The bearish scan mirrors the bullish setup but looks for 4% declines.

### 4.1. Creating a New Combo List

1. Go to **New**.  
2. Select **Open Combo List**.  
3. Name the list: **“4% breakdown”**.

### 4.2. Defining the Source Universe

As with the breakout scan, add:

- **US stocks**  
- **ADRs**  
- **ETFs**

This ensures both scans use the same underlying universe.

### 4.3. Writing the 4% Breakdown Formula

Add a **condition** and write the formula:

Name the condition: **“4% breakdown”**.

Formula logic:

- Price down at least 4% from yesterday:
  - `C / C1 <= 0.96`  
  (Today’s close is 4% or more below yesterday’s close.)

- Today’s volume greater than or equal to yesterday’s volume:
  - `V >= V1`

- Minimum absolute volume:
  - `V >= 100000`

This identifies stocks that are down 4% or more on at least equal or higher volume, with sufficient liquidity.

### 4.4. Applying and Viewing Results

- Run the scan on the defined source list.  
- You will get a set of results (example given: **148 stocks**, including ETFs).  
- Use **Move Window → Tab Here** to place this result list as a tab labeled **“4% breakdown”**.

Now you have two tabs side by side:

- **4% breakout** (bullish candidates)  
- **4% breakdown** (bearish candidates)

## 5. Adding Price Filters to Exclude Low-Priced Stocks

Scanning all stocks will often include very low-priced names, which many traders prefer to avoid. You can refine both lists by adding a **price filter**.

### 5.1. Filtering the 4% Breakout List

1. In the **4% breakout** tab, add a **Filter**.  
2. Choose **Condition** → **Price**.  
3. Set the condition: **Price > 3** (greater than 3 dollars).

Effect:

- The number of breakout candidates drops (example: from 127 to **73** stocks).  
- Very low-priced stocks are removed from the breakout list.

### 5.2. Filtering the 4% Breakdown List

1. In the **4% breakdown** tab, add a **Filter**.  
2. Choose **Condition** → **Price**.  
3. Set the condition: **Price > 3** (greater than 3 dollars).

Effect:

- The number of breakdown candidates is reduced (example: to **90** stocks).  
- Low-priced breakdowns are filtered out.

This step makes the lists more manageable and focused on stocks above a chosen price threshold.

## 6. Using and Refining the Scan

### 6.1. Purpose of the Initial Setup

Setting up the 4% breakout and breakdown scans is the **first step**. Once the scans are in place:

- You can see **what kinds of stocks** show up daily.  
- You get a feel for the **character** of 4% movers with volume.  

This foundational setup is necessary before you start refining or building more complex rules.

### 6.2. Adding Further Filters Over Time

After observing the scan results:

- You may choose to add **more filters** (beyond price and volume) to:
  - Reduce the number of stocks.  
  - Focus on specific types of setups that fit your trading style.  

The lesson emphasizes that this initial 4% breakout and breakdown configuration is the **starting point**. Once you are comfortable with what appears in these lists, you can systematically refine them to make your trading process easier and more efficient.
