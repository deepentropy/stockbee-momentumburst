## 1. Overview of the Two-Inch Setup

The “two-inch” setup is a specific breakout pattern used in day and swing trading. While it has a core structure, it can appear in multiple variations. Understanding these variations is essential to correctly identify valid setups rather than rigidly expecting only one exact pattern.

## 2. Importance of Recognizing Variations

### 2.1. Length of Consolidation

- The consolidation phase before the breakout can vary in length.  
- Sometimes consolidation is **just three days**.  
- Sometimes it can be **longer** and still fully meet the two-inch criteria.  
- The trader emphasizes that knowing and recognizing these variations is important for effective trading.

### 2.2. Acceptable Price Behavior During Consolidation

- During consolidation, the stock may have **some negative (down) days**.  
- However, these down days must **not** include a **4% breakdown** or larger.  
- The acceptable pattern is essentially **sideways movement** without significant breakdowns.

## 3. Example: ENTA Two-Inch Setup

The stock ENTA is used as an example of a valid two-inch setup with a slightly different “flavor” from earlier examples.

### 3.1. First Leg Characteristics

- ENTA shows a clear **first leg up** before consolidation.  
- This first leg is characterized by **aggressive buying**.  
- The setup is described as a **“young” setup**, implying it is early in its move, not an extended or late-stage pattern.

### 3.2. Consolidation Phase Details

- After the first leg, ENTA goes into a **longer consolidation** period.  
- The stock **goes sideways** for a longer time rather than just a brief pause.  
- There are **some negative days**, but:
  - No day shows a **4% or more breakdown**.
  - The overall structure remains intact and sideways, not a deep pullback.

### 3.3. Breakout Characteristics

- After the sideways consolidation, ENTA has a **clean breakout**:
  - The stock **closes near the high of the day**.
  - The breakout day does **not** show the stock being **up two days in a row** into the breakout; it breaks out cleanly from the consolidation.
  - There is **no significant giving up of gains** intraday; the move holds into the close.
- This behavior fits the desired breakout profile for the two-inch setup.

## 4. Practical Criteria and Preferences

### 4.1. Minimum Consolidation Duration

- The trader **likes at least three days of consolidation** before the breakout.  
- **Less than three days** of consolidation is **not preferred** for this setup.

### 4.2. Longer Consolidations That Still Qualify

- Consolidation can be **longer than three days** and still be a valid two-inch setup.  
- ENTA is presented as an example of a **longer consolidation** that still qualifies:
  - Strong first leg with aggressive buying.
  - Sideways action without a 4% breakdown.
  - Clean breakout afterward.

### 4.3. Confirming the Setup Meets Two-Inch Criteria

- Even with variations in consolidation length and minor negative days, the key question is:  
  **Does it meet the two-inch criteria?**  
- In the ENTA example, the answer is **yes**:
  - Young setup with a strong first leg.
  - Sideways consolidation without major breakdowns.
  - Clean breakout with a close near the high and no loss of gains.
