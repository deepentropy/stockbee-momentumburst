## 1. Position Sizing for Breakout Trades

### 1.1. Defining Risk per Trade

- After you find a 4% breakout setup and decide:
  - Entry price  
  - Stop loss level  
- The next key question is: **How many shares to buy / how much to risk on that setup?**

For breakout setups, especially if you are new:

- Typical risk per trade:
  - 0.25% of account (very conservative)  
  - 0.5% of account (conservative)  
  - 1% of account (standard for many traders)

“Risk” here means: **the dollar amount you will lose if your stop is hit.**

### 1.2. Example Account and Risk Levels

- Example account size: **$100,000**
- If you risk **1%** per trade:
  - You are willing to lose **$1,000** if the stop is hit.
- If you risk **0.5%** per trade:
  - You are willing to lose **$500** if the stop is hit.

All position sizing is built around this fixed dollar risk per trade.

## 2. Using the Position Size Calculator Tool

### 2.1. Inputs Required

On the StockBee site, there is a **position sizing tool** under the Tools tab. To use it, you input:

1. **Account size** (e.g., 100,000)  
2. **Risk percentage per trade** (e.g., 1% or 0.5%)  
3. **Entry price** of the stock  
4. **Stop price** (e.g., low of day or half of day’s range)

The tool then calculates:

- How many shares you can buy  
- How much capital that position will use  
- The dollar loss if the stop is hit (matching your chosen risk %)

### 2.2. Example 1: Stop at Low of Day

Stock example: **ECH**

- Account size: **$100,000**  
- Risk: **1%** (i.e., $1,000 risk)  
- Entry price: **$29.61**  
- Stop price: **Low of the day = $27.57**

Input into the tool:

- Account: 100,000  
- Risk: 1%  
- Entry: 29.61  
- Stop: 27.57  

The tool output (as described):

- You can buy **490 shares**  
- You will be putting about **$14,000–15,000** into the trade  
- If the stop at 27.57 is hit, you lose **$1,000** (1% of account)

This is what is meant by **“taking 1% risk”** on the trade.

### 2.3. Example 2: Stop at Half of Day’s Range

Same stock (ECH), but using **half of the day’s range** as the stop:

- Half of day’s range stop: **$28.63**

Input into the tool:

- Account: 100,000  
- Risk: 1%  
- Entry: 29.61  
- Stop: 28.63  

Because the stop is **closer** to the entry than the low of day:

- The **per-share risk is smaller**, so  
- The tool allows you to buy **more shares** (roughly double compared to the wider stop example).

In this example, using 28.63 as stop:

- You end up putting about **30% of your account** into this one position.  
- With that sizing, **3 such setups** would make you **fully invested**.

If you make the stop even closer, say **$29.00**, the tool will show:

- You can put up to around **48% of your account** into this single trade (because the per-share risk is very small).

### 2.4. Rounding Share Quantities

The tool may give you non-round share numbers (e.g., 490 shares).

Practical advice:

- Round to a nearby clean number:
  - e.g., 490 → **500 shares** or keep it at 490  
- Avoid worrying about small odd-lot differences; focus on approximate sizing.

## 3. Relationship Between Stop Distance and Position Size

### 3.1. Closer Stops → Larger Position Size

Key principle:

- **The closer your stop is to your entry, the larger your position size can be** for the same dollar risk.

Examples from the lesson:

- Stop at low of day (27.57) → fewer shares, smaller % of account in the trade.  
- Stop at half of day’s range (28.63) → more shares, about 30% of account in the trade.  
- Stop very close (e.g., 29.00) → even more shares, up to ~48% of account in the trade.

So:

- **Tighter stop = bigger position**  
- **Wider stop = smaller position**

### 3.2. Impact on Percentage of Account in One Trade

Because position size is tied to stop distance:

- With a **tighter stop**, you may end up with a **very large percentage** of your account in a single trade (30–48% in the examples).  
- With a **wider stop**, your **capital per trade** is smaller.

As you gain:

- More **expertise** with the setup  
- Higher **confidence** and **win rate**

You may choose to **increase position size** (within your risk rules), which helps the account grow faster. But this should be done only after you have proven consistency.

## 4. How Stop Placement Determines Number of Positions

### 4.1. Account Allocation per Setup

Your **stop distance** and **risk per trade** determine:

- How much of your account goes into each position  
- Therefore, how many positions you can hold at once

Example:

- If using half of day’s range as stop (28.63 in the ECH example):
  - You might put **30% of your account** into one trade.  
  - With that sizing, **3 trades** would make you **fully invested**.

If you use an even tighter stop (e.g., 29.00):

- You might put **45–48% of your account** into one trade.  
- Then you may only be able to take **2 positions** before you are fully invested.

### 4.2. Realistic Number of Positions to Manage

Guidance:

- **3–4 positions** are generally **manageable**.  
- Fewer positions (e.g., 2) can be even easier to manage.  
- Having **10–20 small positions** is possible, but:
  - It becomes difficult to **truly manage** them well.  
  - Many tiny positions don’t help much in terms of meaningful returns.

Analogy:

- Managing positions is like managing children:
  - 2–3 kids: manageable  
  - 10–20 kids: possible, but are you really managing them?

So, instead of many tiny positions:

- Focus on **fewer, properly sized positions** based on your stop and risk rules.

## 5. Practical Use of Tools vs. Mental Calculation

### 5.1. Importance of a Handy, Fast Tool

The position sizing tool (or your own equivalent) should be:

- **Immediately available** when you are trading  
- **Fast and simple** to use

Workflow:

1. Decide entry and stop (e.g., low of day or half of day’s range).  
2. Input account size, risk %, entry, and stop into the tool.  
3. Get the **exact number of shares** to buy.  
4. Place the order, optionally rounding the share count.

This ensures:

- You know **exactly how much you are risking**.  
- You avoid random or emotional position sizing.

If you prefer, you can create your own calculator, but it must be:

- Quick  
- Easy  
- Always ready when you trade

### 5.2. Transition to Flat Position Sizing with Experience

With experience, you may not need the tool for every trade.

Pradeep’s own practice now:

- Uses **flat share sizes** (e.g., 3,000 or 5,000 shares per trade) in a **million-dollar account**.  
- Relies on **mental calculation** to know:
  - What 0.5% or 1% of the account is in dollars  
  - Whether the chosen share size fits within that risk

Because of experience:

- He can quickly estimate risk without a tool.  
- But this is **not recommended for beginners** until they are comfortable and accurate with the math.

## 6. Recommended Approach for Beginners

### 6.1. Start with the Tool

For beginners:

- **Use the position sizing tool** on the site.  
- Always input:
  - Account size  
  - Risk % (0.25%, 0.5%, or 1%)  
  - Entry price  
  - Stop price (low of day or half of day’s range)

Then:

- Take the share number from the tool.  
- Optionally round to a nearby clean number (e.g., 490 → 500).  
- Place the trade knowing exactly:
  - How much capital is used  
  - How much you will lose if the stop is hit

Over time:

- As you gain confidence and speed, you can transition to:
  - Your own tools, or  
  - Flat share sizing with mental calculations.

### 6.2. Risk Levels and Position Count Guidelines

- For **new traders**:
  - Consider starting with **0.25%–0.5%** risk per trade.  
  - Move to **1%** only after gaining experience and consistency.

- Keep the number of positions:
  - Around **3–4**, based on how much of your account each trade uses.  
  - Avoid many tiny positions that are hard to manage and don’t move the needle.

Overall, the lesson’s core message:

- **Define your risk per trade first.**  
- **Use a tool to calculate position size based on your stop.**  
- **Let stop distance and risk rules determine both position size and number of positions.**  
- Start systematic and precise; only later, with experience, simplify to mental or flat sizing if it suits you.
