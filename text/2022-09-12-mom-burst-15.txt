 So let's look at 4% breakout and let's see what really are we scanning for in a 4% breakout. Now 4% breakout looks for a stock which is either up 4% on a high volume or a stock which is down on a 4% on a high volume. First part of this we are going to look at 4% breakout to the bullish side. 4% breakout is basically a stock which is up 4% plus volume is greater than yesterday's volume and volume is greater than 100,000. So three conditions needs to be met for a stock to be considered a 4% breakout. So all these conditions if the stock meets it will show up in your 4% breakout scan. Let's look at 4% breakdown. Now this is a 4% breakdown scan. In this particular case the stock is down 4% plus. So stock is down 4% plus. Volume is greater than yesterday's volume and volume is greater than 100,000. So this is a 4% breakdown scan. So there is a bullish side to a 4% breakout and there is a bearish side to a 4% breakout. So let's look at a 4% breakout scan in TC2000. Now this same bullish scan which I looked at there is here. And if you run it. On US common stock exchange traded fund and American depository receipts. Then what you will see on the Friday on which on Saturday and I recorded this video and this is the data from Friday. There are 127 stocks which are making meeting 4% plus condition. So this is one of the stocks which is meeting 4% condition. As you can see the stock is up 7.91%. So it's up more than 4%. The stock has volume which is greater than yesterday's volume. The 5.2 million volume is greater than yesterday's. Where it was 1.2 million volume. And the volume is greater than 100,000. So it meets all the three conditions. So it will appear in your bullish breakout scan. So that is how a bullish breakout scan will work. Let's look at 4% breakdown scan. Now this is a 4% breakdown scan. And same thing and this is the scan. Now once you have this. Where you are looking for 3%. Where you are looking for 3%. Where you are looking for 3%. Where you are looking for 3%. Where you are looking for 3%. Where you are looking for 3%. Stock is down 4%. Volume is greater than V1. And volume is greater than 100,000. And if you run it on Friday 148 stocks meet this particular condition. This is the kind of a stock which will show up like if you see there. Stock is down 8%. Volume is greater than yesterday's volume. Volume today was 599,000 shares traded. Yesterday was 337 shares traded. And volume is greater than 100,000. So this is an example of a bearish breakdown. So 4% breakout and 4% breakdown looks for a range expansion. When a stock shows up in a 4% breakout or 4% breakdown. And if it didn't have that kind of a breakout yesterday or day before yesterday. And it's a range expansion or it is a start up of a momentum burst. Now not all stocks which show up in a scan are going to meet your buy conditions or sell conditions. But before we look at the buy conditions and sell conditions. I will show you in the next video how to set up this particular scan in TC2000 step by step for both bullish and bearish side.
