## 1. Overview of the “Tool Inch” Setup

The “tool inch” setup is a breakout pattern that often appears when a stock, sector, or the overall market has recently put in a bottom and then starts turning up. The setup is especially powerful when it occurs early in a new up-leg, after a clear bottoming process.

Key idea:  
- You may not capture the very first tick off the bottom, but the second leg of the move can develop very quickly and offer a strong, tradable opportunity.

---

## 2. Market and Sector Bottoms as Context

Tool inch setups frequently appear:

- After the **overall market** has formed a bottom and begins to turn up.  
- After a **specific sector** (e.g., biotechnology) has bottomed and starts to recover.

In these environments:

- Multiple stocks in the same sector can show similar bottoming and turning patterns at roughly the same time.  
- The setups that form near these lows can be particularly powerful because they are aligned with a fresh, emerging uptrend.

## 3. Structure of a High-Quality Tool Inch Setup

A good tool inch setup has a clear, structured sequence:

### 3.1. First Leg of the Move

- The stock has been **going down** and then **turns** (puts in a bottom).  
- The **first leg up** after this turn is:
  - **Very linear** (price moves up in a relatively straight, consistent manner).  
  - Shows **a lot of buying** and **hardly any selling**.  
- This first leg indicates strong demand and the presence of committed buyers.

### 3.2. Consolidation Characteristics

After the first leg up:

- The stock enters an **orderly consolidation**.  
- Consolidation features:
  - **Orderly** price action (no wild swings).  
  - **Narrow** range or even a **negative day** just prior to the breakout.  
- The consolidation suggests that:
  - Buyers are **still in control**.  
  - There is **no significant profit-taking** or distribution.  
  - The stock is **resting** before the next move higher.

### 3.3. Breakout Day Characteristics

On the breakout day:

- The stock **breaks out of the consolidation**.  
- The **breakout day closes near the high** of the day.  
- This confirms:
  - Strong buying pressure into the close.  
  - Continuation of the uptrend that started with the first leg.

When all these elements are present—linear first leg, orderly consolidation, and a breakout closing near the high—the stock often makes a **strong follow-through move**.

## 4. Example: Biotechnology Stocks Near Lows

An example mentioned is a setup in **biotechnology stocks**:

- Many biotech names formed bottoms around the same time as the market.  
- After bottoming, they showed:
  - A **strong first leg up** with heavy buying and minimal selling.  
  - **Orderly consolidations** near the lows.  
  - **Breakouts** that fit the tool inch definition.

These examples illustrate how tool inch setups can work **very well near lows**, especially when both the sector and the broader market share similar bottoming and turning patterns.

---

## 5. Using the 4% Breakout Scan

To find these setups in real time:

- Run a **4% breakout scan**.  
- When you see a stock that:
  - Has just put in a bottom,  
  - Shows a **linear first leg up**,  
  - Has an **orderly consolidation**, and  
  - Is now breaking out by around **4% or more**,  
- That is when you should **get excited** and pay close attention.

The **best candidates** are those that are in the **first leg** of a new move after a bottom, not those that are already extended after multiple legs up.

---

## 6. Probability and Timing of Breakouts

### 6.1. Why First-Leg Setups Are High Probability

The **first tool inch setup** that forms after a bottom is the **highest probability**:

- Strong initial buying shows **fresh demand**.  
- Small, orderly consolidation indicates **buyers are not exiting**.  
- The stock has **room to run**, as the new uptrend is just beginning.

Because of this, the first-leg tool inch setup can “really keep on going up” once it breaks out.

### 6.2. Increased Failure Rate Later in the Move

As the move progresses:

- The **later** you try to trade breakouts in the same stock (after multiple legs up),  
- The **higher the failure rate** of those breakouts.

Reason:

- Later-stage breakouts occur after much of the move may already be done.  
- There is more risk of:
  - Exhaustion of buyers.  
  - Increased profit-taking.  
  - Failed breakouts and reversals.

Therefore, focus your efforts on **early, first-leg tool inch setups** near bottoms, and be cautious with **late-stage breakouts** that occur after the stock has already moved significantly.
