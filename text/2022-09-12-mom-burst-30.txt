 Understanding of nuances is very important. There are small nuances which you need to notice in a setup and the more you study and more you get comfortable with these nuances, you are going to find it's easier to avoid setups which are not really meeting your exact criteria. Now for that let me go and show you this particular setup. Now if you are looking at this setup, you might consider this as a good setup on this day but one of the conditions in tool inches we are looking at 2 L Y young setup. Now in this particular case there is a first leg, this is the second leg, this is the third leg and this is the fourth leg of the setup. Now these kind of setups where the move becomes so apparent and people are like really like looking at this, these are the setups which most of the time because they look so apparent, they are not really looking at the same thing. So these setups which are so apparent are the one which will tend to fail. So understand that first leg of the move, if you can capture second leg is very good because that's a easier leg. The more it becomes extended and more it becomes an apparent setup is when you will see that they tend to fail. So try and get into younger setup and understanding that youngness is extremely important to become good at trading tool inch kind of setups.
