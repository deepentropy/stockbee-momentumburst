## 1. Overview of Momentum Burst Magnitude

**Concept:**  
A momentum burst is a short-term, sharp move in a stock’s price following a breakout and range expansion. These moves have a typical magnitude that traders should understand and use to set realistic profit expectations.

**Typical Magnitude:**

- In percentage terms:  
  - Approximately **8% to 40%** in **3–5 days**.
- In dollar terms (for higher-priced stocks):  
  - Approximately **$10 to $300** per share over the burst period.

Understanding this range helps you avoid undercutting your profit potential and align your targets with what the setup can realistically deliver.

## 2. Relationship Between Stock Price and Momentum Burst

Momentum burst magnitude behaves differently depending on the price level of the stock. The key distinction is:

- **Lower-priced stocks:** Larger moves in **percentage** terms.  
- **Higher-priced stocks:** Larger moves in **dollar** terms, but smaller in percentage.

### 2.1. Low-Priced Stocks (Below $10)

- Typical momentum burst: **20% to 40%** in **3–5 days** after breakout.  
- Very low-priced stocks (e.g., around $4) can show:
  - **100%+ moves** in a few days in strong bursts.
  - Frequent **70%, 50%, 40%** type moves in 3–5 days in some cases.
- For stocks **below $10**, your **objective** should be:
  - Aim for **20%–40%** gains per momentum burst.
  - Most common range: **20%–30%**.

### 2.2. Mid-Priced Stocks ($10–$40)

- Typical momentum burst: **8% to 20%** in **3–5 days**.
- These stocks generally do not move as explosively in percentage terms as sub-$10 stocks, but still offer solid short-term gains.

### 2.3. High-Priced Stocks ($100+)

- For stocks trading at **$100 and above**:
  - Momentum bursts are better measured in **dollar terms** rather than percentage.
  - Typical burst magnitude: **$10 to $50** per share in a few days.
- Example:
  - On a **$300 stock**, a **$10 move** is relatively small and not a good trade in this context.
  - On such stocks, you should expect and look for **$30 to $50** moves in a momentum burst.

### 2.4. Super High-Priced Stocks ($500+ / $1000)

- For **$500+ stocks**:
  - Momentum bursts can be **$50 to $300** per share over **8–10 days**.
- For **$1000 stocks**:
  - A **$50 to $300** move may only be **3% to 8%**.
- Key point:
  - The **absolute dollar move** can be large, but the **percentage move** is relatively modest compared to low-priced stocks.

---

## 3. Time Frame of Momentum Burst Moves

- Typical duration of a momentum burst:
  - **3 to 5 days** for most setups.
  - In some high-priced or super high-priced stocks, the move can extend to **8–10 days**.
- The burst usually follows:
  - A **breakout** and a **range expansion** day (a day where the price move is larger than recent days).

---

## 4. Practical Profit Expectations by Price Category

Align your profit targets with the stock’s price level:

- **Below $10:**
  - Aim for **20%–40%** in **3–5 days**.
  - Very low-priced names can occasionally deliver **50%–100%+** bursts.
- **$10–$40:**
  - Expect **8%–20%** in **3–5 days**.
- **$100+ (high-priced):**
  - Expect **$10–$50** per share in **3–5 days**.
- **$500+ / $1000 (super high-priced):**
  - Expect **$50–$300** per share in **8–10 days**, which often translates to **3%–8%**.

Using these ranges prevents you from exiting too early (undercutting profit potential) or holding for unrealistic targets.

## 5. Examples of Momentum Burst in High-Priced Stocks

### 5.1. Example: Booking Holdings (BKNG)

- Very high-priced stock (example used to illustrate large dollar moves).
- Observations:
  - A **3-day momentum burst** produced a move of about **$96**.
  - Another momentum burst:
    - Range expansion day where the stock was up about **$62** on that day alone.
    - From the entry on that range expansion day, over the next **3–4 days**, the stock moved approximately **$168**.
- Takeaway:
  - **$50–$100+** swings in a few days are common in such high-priced names.
  - This is why some traders focus specifically on high-priced stocks: the **absolute dollar gains** per share can be very large.

### 5.2. Example: McKesson (MCK)

- High-priced stock trading around **$300**.
- A clear **range expansion** day marked the start of a momentum burst:
  - The move from that range expansion:
    - In **5–6 days**, the stock moved about **$27**.
- Takeaway:
  - On high-priced stocks, **$10–$40+** moves in a few days are typical for a good momentum burst.
  - A **$27** move on a $300 stock is a standard, solid burst.

## 6. Examples of Momentum Burst in Low-Priced Stocks

- Example: A **$4 stock**:
  - After a breakout, a momentum burst in **3–5 days** produced a **114%** move.
  - Another burst in the same stock produced about **100%**.
- Other low-priced examples (generalized from recent moves):
  - Stocks under $10 showing:
    - **70%**, **50%**, **40%** momentum bursts in **3–5 days**.
    - An **$8 stock** with a **30%** momentum burst.
    - Another low-priced stock with a **27%** burst.
    - A momentum burst of **24%** in **4 days**.
- Takeaway:
  - For **low-priced stocks**, especially **below $10**, **20%–40%** in **3–5 days** is common and should be your **primary target range**.
  - Very low-priced names can be **“very, very explosive”** in percentage terms.

## 7. Key Psychological and Tactical Takeaways

1. **Match Expectations to Price Level**  
   - Do not expect the same percentage move from a $300 stock as from a $4 stock.  
   - For low-priced stocks, think in **percentages** (20–40%+).  
   - For high-priced stocks, think in **dollars** ($10–$300).

2. **Avoid Undercutting Profit Potential**  
   - If you understand the typical magnitude of a momentum burst for the price range you are trading, you are less likely to:
     - Exit too early with small profits.
     - Misjudge what a “good” move looks like for that stock.

3. **Use Range Expansion as a Trigger**  
   - Momentum bursts often start with a **range expansion day**:
     - A day where the price move is larger than recent days.
   - Entries are often considered on or just after such a day, and the subsequent **3–5 days** (or up to **8–10 days** for very high-priced stocks) are where the burst plays out.

4. **Set Clear, Realistic Targets**  
   - For **below $10**: aim for **20–40%**.  
   - For **$10–$40**: aim for **8–20%**.  
   - For **$100+**: aim for **$10–$50**.  
   - For **$500+ / $1000**: aim for **$50–$300** over a slightly longer window.

By internalizing these ranges and examples, you can structure your momentum burst trades with realistic, price-appropriate profit targets and avoid both over- and under-expectation in your day and swing trading.
