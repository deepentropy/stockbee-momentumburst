## 1. Introduction: Context of the Lesson

This lesson focuses on where to place stop-loss orders when trading breakout setups, specifically within a “momentum burst” framework. The discussion assumes you have already identified a breakout stock (e.g., using tools like TC2000 and “two links”) and have entered the trade. The central question is: **where should the stop be placed to manage risk while respecting the nature of a momentum burst?**

## 2. Core Concept: Trading Momentum Bursts

- The underlying phenomenon being traded is a **momentum burst**.  
- A **genuine momentum burst** should:
  - Continue moving in the direction of the breakout.
  - Not give back a large portion of its breakout-day gains quickly.
- Stop placement is designed around this idea:  
  - If the stock gives up too much of the breakout-day move, the **momentum burst is no longer valid**, and the trade should be exited.

## 3. Primary Stop-Loss Strategies on Breakouts

### 3.1. Safest Stop: Low of the Entry Day

- **Definition**: Place the stop at the **low of the breakout day** (the day you entered).  
- Example (from TC2000 chart):
  - Breakout day low: **30.12**  
  - Stop is placed at **30.12**.
- Characteristics:
  - Considered the **safest** stop because it gives the trade maximum room within that day’s range.
  - However, this can be a **very wide stop** in many cases, leading to larger potential losses.

### 3.2. Intermediate Stop: Three-Day Low (Historical Approach)

- Earlier in his trading, Pradeep used:
  - A stop at the **low of the last three days** (three-day low) instead of the breakout-day low.
- Example:
  - Three-day low around **29.36** or **29.24**.
  - Stop would be placed at that three-day low level.
- Characteristics:
  - Tighter than the low-of-day stop if the three-day low is closer to the entry.
  - This was an earlier method before gaining deeper experience with momentum bursts.

### 3.3. Advanced Stop: Half of the Day’s Gain

- Current preferred method (with experience):
  - Place the stop at **half of the breakout day’s gain** or **slightly above half**.
- Logic:
  - If the stock **gives up half of the day’s gain**, the breakout is **no longer a valid momentum burst**.
  - A true momentum burst should **not retrace that deeply** on the breakout day.
- Characteristics:
  - Much **tighter** than low-of-day stops.
  - Reduces risk per trade.
  - Requires **skill in selecting strong breakouts** to avoid frequent stop-outs.

## 4. Experience Level and Stop Placement

### 4.1. Beginners: Why Start with Low-of-Day Stops

- For traders who are:
  - New to this method.
  - Not yet skilled at consistently finding **high-quality breakouts**.
- Recommended approach:
  - Start with **low-of-day stops**.
- Reason:
  - If you use a **half-of-day** stop too early in your learning curve:
    - You may get **shaken out frequently**.
    - Many trades might hit your tight stop even if they later work.
- Low-of-day stops provide:
  - More **room** for normal intraday fluctuations.
  - A more forgiving learning environment while you improve breakout selection.

### 4.2. Transition Goal: Moving Toward Half-Range Stops

- As you gain:
  - More **experience**.
  - Better **understanding** of how momentum bursts behave.
  - Improved **skill in finding good breakouts**.
- The **goal**:
  - Gradually shift from **low-of-day stops** to **half-of-day-range stops**.
- End objective:
  - Consistently place stops at **half of the day’s range** (or slightly above) to:
    - Align with the momentum burst concept.
    - Limit risk more effectively.

## 5. Intraday Management of Stops

- When entering **early** in the breakout (before the stock is up a large percentage, e.g., before it is up 13%):
  - If the stock moves **in your favor**, you can:
    - **Move your stop up during the day**.
- Purpose:
  - To **reduce risk** as the trade becomes profitable.
  - To avoid risking too much on a breakout that has already moved significantly in your favor.
- This intraday adjustment is part of actively managing risk while trading momentum bursts.

---

## 6. Impact of Late Entries on Risk and Reward

- If you enter a breakout **late**:
  - Example: The stock is already up around **13–14%** when you enter.
- Problem:
  - Your stop (e.g., at low of day) might be **13–14% below your entry**.
  - This creates a **very large risk** on the trade.
- Consequence:
  - The **risk/reward** becomes **unfavorable**.
  - The trade may **not be worth taking** due to the wide stop required.
- Key implication:
  - It is **critical** to:
    - **Find breakouts early**.
    - **Enter as soon as you identify** a valid breakout.
  - Early entry allows:
    - Tighter stops.
    - Better risk control.
    - More favorable reward-to-risk profiles.

## 7. Key Practical Takeaways

- The method is built around **trading momentum bursts**; stop placement must reflect that.
- **Stop options**:
  1. **Low of the entry day** – safest, but often too wide; good for beginners.
  2. **Three-day low** – an older, intermediate method.
  3. **Half of the breakout day’s gain** – preferred advanced method; if half is given back, the momentum burst is invalid.
- **For beginners**:
  - Start with **low-of-day stops** to avoid being shaken out prematurely.
- **For experienced traders**:
  - Aim to use **half-of-day-range stops** or slightly above, consistent with the momentum burst concept.
- **Intraday**:
  - If you enter early and the stock moves in your favor, **move your stop up during the day** to reduce risk.
- **Avoid late entries**:
  - Entering when the stock is already up ~13–14% forces very wide stops and poor risk/reward.
  - Focus on **early identification and entry** on breakouts.
