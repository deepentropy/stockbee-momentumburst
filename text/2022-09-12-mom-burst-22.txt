 Let's look at another example of tool inch which will give you a good idea as to what to look for in a good breakout. Now for that again what we are going to do is we are going to go in TC2000 and look for another example of a good tool inch setup which has happened couple of weeks ago or months ago. So let's look at this particular setup. Now this is how it will look on the day of the breakout. Now does it meet your tool inch criteria? So not up two days in a row? Yes. Linearity, you will see that it had very strong persistent buying. The consolidation quality, is it good? Yes. There is no 4% breakdown, orderly consolidation. Is it a young setup? The stock just had first leg and this is the second leg of the setup which is starting. So it's not a fourth, fifth or sixth kind of a setup which you are looking at. So tool inch, young, narrow or negative day prior to consolidation. Consolidation, consolidation quality good, closing near high. All boxes it ticks. So this is the kind of a setup if you can keep looking at as an ideal example of a template to look for in a breakout. See first leg, orderly consolidation, breaking out near high, negative and narrow range day before the breakout, not up two days in a row, everything. Then your probability of success in trading 4% breakout is going to improve significantly. So this is the kind of a setup. If you make a mistake in selecting setup and enter wrong choppy setups, then what is going to happen is your results are going to be choppy. So try and select setups which look like this every day and if you select setups only which look like this, you will have no problem in finding and entering good setups.
