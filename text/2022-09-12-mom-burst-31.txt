 More examples of tool inch you study, the better you become in this game. So let's look at another example of tool inch so that you have very clear clarity about what is involved in doing this kind of a tool inch kind of a setup. So here again you will see that this particular stock had this first leg of the move. It went sideways right and it went sideways almost for a month resetting the whole thing. When a stock goes sideways for a month or more then it's again reset itself and now this is the first leg. And then you had a consolidation right and it was a very small consolidation. And this is you will say that this is a positive day but like it was just up 0.69% 10 cents right or 18 cents so it wasn't really. So not up two days in a row. Orderly consolidation. There is no 4% breakdown. It's breaking out and it's closing near the high. And because it had a strong linearity in the first leg even here it had a linearity. This is a good setup which again meets your tool inch. See the volume. Big volume came into this stock on that particular day. It's up 5% kind of on that particular day. So this is another example of tool inch. And the more examples 300, 400, 500 you study the better you become. When I started trading this 20, 22 years ago. I put together for myself around 1000 examples of this kind of setups. And every day multiple times during the day I used to go through my books of setups. And then I used to like look at a setup in the current market which looks like what was there in my book of ideal setups. So more work you do easier it becomes in real time to find a good break. Breakout.
