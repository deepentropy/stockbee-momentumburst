 So the first method which I developed based on momentum burst 20 years ago was 4% breakout. 4% breakout is a momentum burst scan which I have been using for 20 years. And the background to 4% breakout or why 4% breakout is important to understand. Around 20 years ago, I looked at every stock which has traded in the last 40 years and which had made 25% move in a month. And when we looked at the stocks which had made 25% plus move in a month, what we found is that at the beginning of their move, they typically had 4% breakout. So if I want to capture a stock which makes 25% move in a month, and if at the beginning day of their move, typically they had the frequency which we found, it wasn't 3% move, it wasn't 4%, it wasn't 1% move, 2% move, it was like commonly 4% plus move. So that's the first method which I developed based on momentum burst. So as a result of that, I selected 4% breakout because it was based on the history of like stocks. And since then, I have studied this for last 20 years. And it continues to be the same phenomena. Whenever you look at a stock which is up 25% plus in a month, what you are going to find is that stock has had 4% breakout at the beginning of the move. And this you can check for yourself by studying different periods, different months. Different years. And you will find this as a common characteristic. So the first method which we are going to look at in detail is based on this kind of a historical pattern which I found. And we will get into the next video where I will look at what is the scan which I use, how to scan for, how to create a chart for this particular method which is called 4% breakout. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
