 The most important thing in tool-inch is your ability to select a setup which meets all the criteria and the setups which meet all the criteria satisfy tool-inch condition. Here is another example of that from last one month where you had a stock which showed up in your scan and this is how it looked on the day of the breakout. So again if you look at it here is the first leg there is a three day consolidation now somebody will say this stock is up two days in a row this was just up a little bit just 0.52% so a stock like this I am still going to consider this was not really up this was down so this was just like in a one day right. Now there is no 4% breakdown here and it has consolidation of three days stock is breaking out this stock didn't really exactly close near the high but it was still. Maintaining the same level of consolidation. Maintaining most of the bulk of the days gains so it was still set up like this is still okay so that's why I selected to show you a setup like this again does it meet tool-inch criteria yes is there linearity in the first leg yes strong buying in the first leg consolidation quality good no 4% breakdown narrow or negative day this is hardly a 0.52% day and then the stock breaks out 4% plus right and stock didn't exactly close near the high but it didn't give up. I'm not going to keep this up all too much of again so this is still a good setup and that's the kind of setup which you want to see in 4% breakout again it is a young setup that means it's not a second or third leg of a setup. This had gone sideways for almost a month so again started this leg and this is the first leg only or this is the second part of the leg only so look for these kind of setups which meet tool-inch criteria.
