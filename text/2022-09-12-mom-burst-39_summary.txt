## 1. Overview of the 4% Breakout Momentum Burst Trade

This lesson explains how to manage a 4% breakout “momentum burst” trade after you are already in the position. The focus is not on finding the setup, but on:

- Where to place and how to move stops.
- How to respond to different price behaviors after entry.
- When to exit based on time and profit.
- How to avoid giving back large gains due to poor trade management.

Momentum burst trades in this context are short-term trades, typically lasting 3–5 days, most often 3–4 days.

---

## 2. Initial Trade Setup

### 2.1. Running the 4% Breakout Scan

- You start by running a **4% breakout scan** to find stocks that have made a strong momentum move.
- From the scan results, you select stocks based on your **tool inch** criteria (the specific selection criteria you use; not elaborated further in this excerpt).

### 2.2. Selecting Stocks (Tool Inch Criteria)

- After the scan, you choose a particular setup that fits your rules.
- The lesson assumes you have already done this and are ready to enter.

### 2.3. Entry and Initial Stop Placement

Once you decide to buy:

- You enter on the breakout day (Day 1).
- You place your initial stop:
  - Either at the **low of the day**, or  
  - At **half of the day’s range** (a “half-of-the-day” stop).

Example from the lesson:

- Day 1 range ≈ 45 cents.
- Half-of-the-day stop ≈ 25 cents below your entry.
- This corresponds to roughly **2.5% risk** if the full day’s move is about 5%.

### 2.4. Position Sizing

- You calculate the **number of shares** based on:
  - Your chosen stop distance (low of day or half of day).
  - Your acceptable percentage risk (e.g., 2.5–5%).
- Once you enter and place the stop, you are in the position and trade management begins.

---

## 3. Post-Entry Trade Management Framework

### 3.1. Key Idea: Behavior-Based Stop Management

After entry, several things can happen:

- You get stopped out quickly.
- The stock does nothing for a day or two.
- The stock follows through strongly.

Your stop management must **adapt to what the stock does after entry**. You do not keep the same risk profile once you have a significant profit.

### 3.2. Time-Based Nature of Momentum Burst Trades

- These trades are **inherently short-term**:
  - Most last **3–4 days**.
  - Very few go beyond **5 days**.
- There is a **time stop**:
  - If the stock does not move within a defined time (by Day 3), the trade is considered over.

---

## 4. Scenario 1: Immediate Follow-Through After Entry

This is the “ideal” situation: the stock follows through right after your entry.

### 4.1. Day 1: Entry and Initial Risk

- You enter on Day 1 with a half-of-the-day stop.
- Example:
  - Risk ≈ 2.5% (half of a 5% breakout).
- Your stop is initially placed at that calculated level (e.g., 25 cents below entry).

### 4.2. Day 2: Strong Follow-Through – Reducing Risk

On Day 2, the stock **follows through** and moves up:

- You now have about **6% profit** in the trade.
- Keeping the original stop (still risking ~2.5–3%) **no longer makes sense**:
  - You would be willing to give back too much relative to your open profit.
- Action:
  - **Move your stop up**.
  - Do **not** simply use half of Day 2’s range if that still leaves ~3% risk.
  - Instead, move the stop **slightly above half of Day 2’s range**, so:
    - Worst case: you get stopped out with a **profit**, not a loss.

### 4.3. Day 3: Large Open Profit – Aggressive Stop Tightening

On Day 3, there is another good follow-through:

- By Day 3, you might have around **14% profit**.
- For a **sub-$10 stock**, a typical momentum burst target is around **20%**.
- Even if you are happy with 14–15% in two to three days, you must **protect it aggressively**.

Action on Day 3:

- Move your stop **very aggressively**:
  - Place it just below the Day 3 close.
  - Typically **1–2% below the close**.
- You may choose to risk only about **one-fourth of that day’s gain**.
- The goal:
  - Keep the majority of the profit.
  - Accept that you might get stopped out but with a **solid gain**.

### 4.4. Day 4: Bonus Day – Switch to Tight Trailing Stop

Day 4 is treated as a **bonus**:

- If the stock continues up on Day 4:
  - You **shift your strategy to a trailing stop**.
  - Use a **tight trailing stop**, e.g.:
    - **1–2%** (or 2–3% in general trailing-stop terms mentioned later).
- Implementation:
  - As the stock goes up during the day, your stop trails the price.
  - If the stock reverses, you get stopped out and **lock in profits**.

Key point:

- There is **no reason** to stay in a 4% breakout momentum burst trade **beyond Day 4 or Day 5**.
- By this stage, the **profit-harvesting phase** should be complete.

---

## 5. Scenario 2: Delayed Follow-Through (Move Starts on Day 3)

In this scenario, the stock does not move immediately after entry but eventually works.

### 5.1. Day 1–2: No Move, Original Stop Intact

- You enter on Day 1 with your initial stop (low of day or half-of-day).
- Day 2:
  - The stock **does not really move**; maybe a small up move but no real follow-through.
  - You **do not move your stop**.
  - You keep the **original stop** because nothing meaningful has happened yet.

### 5.2. Day 3: Breakout Finally Works – Locking in Gains

On Day 3, the stock finally makes a **good move**:

- You know momentum bursts typically last **3–4 days**.
- By Day 3, you might have around **10% profit**.

Action:

- Move your stop **very close to the Day 3 gain**:
  - Protect **80–90%** of the profit you have by Day 3.
  - Place the stop just below the Day 3 close (similar logic to Scenario 1, Day 3).

### 5.3. Exit on Pullback After Day 3

- On the next day (Day 4), the stock may **dip below your tightened stop**.
- You get **stopped out** and exit the trade.
- Result:
  - You capture most of the 10% move.
  - You do not hold on hoping for more once the momentum shows signs of stalling.

---

## 6. Scenario 3: No Follow-Through by Day 3 (Time Stop)

This scenario covers trades that **never really get going**.

### 6.1. Recognizing a Failed Momentum Burst

- You buy a breakout on Day 1.
- Day 2:
  - The stock **does not follow through**.
- Day 3:
  - By **midday**, the stock still has **not made a meaningful move**.
  - There is no real momentum burst.

### 6.2. Midday Day 3 Exit Rule

For every 4% breakout momentum burst trade:

- There is a **time stop**:
  - **By Day 3**, if the stock has not moved, the trade is considered **over**.
- Specific rule:
  - **By midday of Day 3**, if there is no follow-through:
    - You **exit the trade**, regardless of:
      - Small profit, or
      - Small loss.
- You do **not** stay in the trade hoping it will eventually work.
- The absence of follow-through by Day 3 is itself a **signal to exit**.

## 7. General Rules for Stop Management in Momentum Burst Trades

### 7.1. When to Move Stops

- **Day 1**:
  - Use initial stop (low of day or half-of-day).
- **Day 2**:
  - If there is **no real move**, keep the original stop.
  - If there is **strong follow-through**, **tighten the stop** to reduce risk and lock in some profit.
- **Day 3**:
  - If the trade has worked (good profit), **move the stop close to the close**:
    - Typically **1–2% below the close**.
    - Aim to keep **80–90%** of the profit by Day 3.

### 7.2. How Much Profit to Protect

- By Day 3:
  - You want to **protect the majority** of your gains:
    - Keep **80–90%** of the open profit.
- You should not be willing to give back a large portion of a 10–15% gain at this stage.

### 7.3. Trailing Stop Parameters

- On Day 4 (and possibly Day 5 if you are still in):
  - Switch to a **trailing stop**.
  - Typical trailing distance:
    - **2–3% below the current price** (or as tight as 1–2% in strong moves).
- As the stock moves up:
  - The stop automatically moves up.
- When the stock reverses:
  - You get stopped out and **exit with profit**.

### 7.4. Time Stop: Maximum Holding Period

- Momentum burst trades are **3–5 day trades**:
  - Most will be **3–4 days**.
  - Very few should be held **beyond 5 days**.
- If the stock has not moved by **midday of Day 3**, you **exit**:
  - This is your **time stop**.
- You do not convert a failed short-term momentum trade into a long-term hold.

---

## 8. Psychological and Behavioral Guidance

### 8.1. Avoiding Greed and Unrealistic Expectations

- After a strong move (e.g., 14–20% in a few days), it is easy to start fantasizing:
  - That the stock will keep going up indefinitely.
  - That you will make enough money to buy extravagant things.
- This mindset leads to **not taking profits** and **giving back gains**.
- The lesson emphasizes:
  - **Do not expect endless continuation**.
  - Treat Day 4 as a **bonus**, not the start of a new long-term trend.

### 8.2. Avoiding Hope-Based Holding

- When a stock does nothing for 2–3 days:
  - Do not **hope** it will eventually move.
  - If there is no follow-through by Day 3, **exit**.
- When you have a profit:
  - Do not hold on just because you **hope** for more.
  - Use **rules** (tight stops, trailing stops, time stops) instead of hope.

### 8.3. Importance of Trade Management vs. Entry

- Managing the trade **after entry** is **as important** as:
  - Finding the setup.
  - Getting the entry right.
- Your **profit outcome** is determined largely by:
  - How you **move stops**.
  - How you **harvest profits**.
  - How you **respect time stops**.
- A good entry without disciplined management will not produce consistent results.

This structured approach to managing 4% breakout momentum burst trades ensures that:

- Risk is controlled from the start.
- Profits are aggressively protected once the trade works.
- Capital is not tied up in trades that fail to follow through.
