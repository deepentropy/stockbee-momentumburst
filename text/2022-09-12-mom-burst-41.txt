 How much will be the percentage stop on an average percentage stop on a 4% breakout? Let's look at that. Now, whenever you are trading 4% breakout, your average stop is going to be a function of the kind of price points which you are focusing on. If you are going to be focusing on stocks priced below $5, typically those stocks are going to break out with anywhere from 10 to 20%. Many times 20% on the first day of breakout itself is the kind of a breakout. In that case, your stops, even if you put it at half of the day's range, is going to be 10%. Now, if you are trading stocks which are slightly from $10 to $40 kind of a thing, then they are going to break out with anywhere between 4% to 10%. So, in that case, your average stop is going to be 5% to 6%. 5% if you are going to be using half of the days, but if you are going to be using low of the day as a stop, then you are going to be using half of the days. So, in that case, your average stop is going to be 5% to 6%. If you are going to be using half of the days as a stop, then you are going to be using half of the days as a stop. Your stop will be anywhere from 5% to 10%. Now, if you really go into the higher price stocks, higher price stocks are going to break out with just 4%, 4.5%, 5%. So, in that case, if you are going to use half of the days stop, you can get 2.5% to 3% kind of a stop. So, you have to be very clear, your price point is going to determine what is the kind of a stop which you can get. Can you get 2.5% stop on a 4% break? Some cases, yes, where the breakout is only 5%, but then also there is a choice. When I go through the list of breakout which happen for a day, and when I look at all the breakouts, and if something is breaking out 20%, then I, for my personal trading, don't even enter that trade because it will involve, even if I put my stop at half of the day, at 10%. So, by selecting breakouts which are more near 5%, 6%, I can still control my stop to around 2.5% to 3%. Now, if you are looking for a closer stop than that, this is not a method for you. Average stops, when I was exclusively trading 4% breakout and not really looking at even taking lower price stocks in the beginning years, my average stop was around 8%. As I learned more and more about this particular momentum burst and started trading more higher and higher price, I have reduced my stop significantly. But you have to remember that I not only trade 4% breakout, I trade dollar breakout, which tend to give you a very much lower than the average stop of 5% to 6%. And also, I have perfected a way of entering these setups very early. So, if you don't have early entries, you're going to enter near the end of the day or 3 o'clock or 3.30 or 4 o'clock, your stops on an average on a 4% breakouts are going to be in the middle of the day. So, you're going to be in the region of 5% to 10% depending on what is your price point. And the lower the price point you're going to trade, a lot of you want to trade $1 stocks or below $1 or $2 stocks, your stops realistically for the method to work will have to be 20%. So, keep that in mind. And that is why even though lower price stocks make bigger moves, correspondingly, your stop has to be wider. In order to accommodate the volatility in higher price stocks. So, if you want to reduce your stops on 4% breakout, you have to incorporate buying early, you have to incorporate only focusing on setups where when you get into them, they are around 5-6% up and then putting in stops near half of the day. Otherwise, realistically, you'll never be able to get stops of 2.5% to 3% on just trading 4% breakout. So, that's why you should be looking at the lower price stocks. So, that's why you should be looking at the lower price stocks.
