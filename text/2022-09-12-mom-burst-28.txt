 The more you study variation of 2-Lynch, the better you will get at it. Sometimes what happens is the overall market starts making a move and then you are going to get a lot of breakouts and those breakouts and the first initial stages are going to look different from a typical conventional 2-Lynch kind of a setup because the market itself wasn't really rallying, it was in a downtrend, so a lot of stocks are not really having the first leg. So here is an example of that kind of a setup where I am going to show you two setups on the stocks and which are like the kind of variations which you need to be cognizant or study for it to know that 2-Lynch can come in different forms. Here is a stock which tried to break out here, the market itself was weak, it tried to break out that day, but then this is a clean breakout which is happening where the stock is closing near high, there is a consolidation, there is a first leg. And So you see that the same stock again set up because the market started going up and that particular sector also started going up and you will see that after some days, it has this consolidation which wasn't really the best of consolidation, but then it had a very strong buying and then consolidation and then had a breakout. So these kind of variations of setups, in the first phase what you should do is only focus on the A quality. But as you go. You become better and better at this, the more variations of 4% breakout which you can add to your arsenal, you will have more trading opportunities to become good at finding more opportunities using 4% breakout.
