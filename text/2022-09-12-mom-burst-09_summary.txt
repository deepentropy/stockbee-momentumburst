## 1. Introduction: Momentum Burst and Low Float Stocks

**Main Idea:**  
You do not need to trade low float stocks to make money using the momentum burst strategy. Momentum bursts can occur in stocks with a wide range of floats, including medium and high float names.

Pradeep emphasizes that traders often mistakenly believe low float is required for strong moves. This lesson clarifies that the momentum burst setup itself is what matters, not the float level.

## 2. Core Principle: Float Is Not a Necessary Condition

**Main Idea:**  
Low float is *not* a necessary condition for a momentum burst to work.

- Momentum bursts can happen on:
  - Low float stocks  
  - Medium float stocks  
  - High float stocks  
- Many stocks with **explosive momentum bursts** actually have **high float**.
- The correct approach is to **trade momentum burst as an isolated phenomenon**, independent of float.

If you treat low float as a requirement, you are adding a condition that is **not necessary** for the strategy to work.

## 3. Evidence from Examples

Pradeep refers to examples using TC2000 to illustrate that momentum bursts occur across a wide range of floats and still produce large percentage moves.

### 3.1. Momentum Bursts in Medium Float Stocks

Examples mentioned:

- Stock with **18.6 million** float:
  - Produced a strong momentum burst.
- Stock with **50 million** float:
  - Worked very well.
  - Made about **155%** move in a momentum burst.
- Another stock:
  - Made about **53%** move in a momentum burst.

These examples show that even floats in the tens of millions can generate very large momentum bursts.

### 3.2. Momentum Bursts in High Float Stocks

Additional examples:

- Stock with **35 million** float:
  - Had a momentum burst.
- Stock with **100 million** float:
  - Had a momentum burst that worked very well.
- Stock with **123 million** float:
  - Had a momentum burst.
  - Stock made about **23%** move.
- Another momentum burst:
  - Stock made about **59%** move.

These demonstrate that high float stocks can still deliver strong, tradable bursts.

### 3.3. Very High Float and Large Moves

- Example with **482 million** shares (very high float):
  - Stock made about **21%** move on a momentum burst.
- Another momentum burst on a high float stock:
  - Stock made a “big move” (significant gain).

The key takeaway from all these examples:  
**Float size does not prevent a stock from having a powerful momentum burst.**

## 4. Common Mistake: Over-Filtering by Float

**Main Idea:**  
Restricting trades only to low float stocks (e.g., below 10 million) will cause you to miss many profitable momentum bursts.

- If you say: “I will only trade stocks below 10 million float,” then:
  - You will **miss out on many momentum bursts**.
  - You will miss moves in stocks with:
    - 18.6 million float  
    - 25 million float  
    - 35 million float  
    - 50 million float  
    - 100+ million float  
    - 400+ million float  
- Using float as a strict filter is described as a **“best kind of a filter” that actually leaves you out of many good momentum bursts** (i.e., it feels logical but is counterproductive for this strategy).

The psychological trap:  
Traders keep “adding conditions” (like float limits) that are not required, which reduces opportunity and performance.

## 5. Practical Guidance: How to Think About Momentum Burst

**Main Idea:**  
Focus on the momentum burst pattern itself, not on float or other unrelated filters.

Key guidance:

- **Do not care about float** when trading momentum bursts.
- **Do not care about the 200-day moving average** in the context of this specific momentum burst approach.
- **Do not keep adding unnecessary conditions** (like strict float caps) that are not essential for the setup to work.

The emphasis is on:

- Identifying the **momentum burst** as a standalone phenomenon.
- Trading the **price action and the burst behavior**, rather than trying to predict or filter based on float.

---

## 6. Conclusion: Focus on the Momentum Burst Itself

**Main Idea:**  
To make money with the momentum burst strategy, you must focus on the momentum burst itself and avoid overcomplicating the setup with unnecessary filters like float or the 200-day moving average.

Summary points:

- Low float is **not required** for momentum bursts.
- Momentum bursts occur in **all float ranges**, including very high float stocks.
- Over-filtering by float will cause you to **miss many profitable trades**.
- The correct approach:  
  - **Trade momentum burst as an isolated phenomenon.**  
  - **Don’t care about float.**  
  - **Don’t care about the 200-day moving average** for this specific strategy.

The core message:  
If you want to make money using momentum bursts, concentrate on the **momentum burst pattern itself**, not on float-based constraints.
