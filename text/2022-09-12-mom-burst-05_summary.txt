## 1. Introduction: Momentum Bursts and 52-Week Levels

A central question in this lesson is whether a momentum burst must start near a 52-week high to be profitable, or whether it can also start from a 52-week low and still make significant money. The instructor emphasizes repeatedly that momentum bursts from 52-week lows not only work, but can often lead to very large moves.

## 2. Key Concept: Momentum Bursts Can Start From 52-Week Lows

**Main Idea:**  
A momentum burst can start from any price level, including near a 52-week low, and still produce substantial profits.

**Explanation:**

- Momentum bursts that begin near 52-week lows can lead to:
  - 100–200% moves in some cases.
  - Moves that are larger than many bursts starting near 52-week highs.
- The instructor stresses multiple times:  
  - “The answer is yes” — momentum bursts from 52-week lows can make a lot of money.
  - These setups are valid and should not be ignored.

## 3. Common Misconception: Only Trading Near 52-Week Highs

**Main Idea:**  
Focusing only on stocks near 52-week highs is a limiting belief that causes traders to miss profitable opportunities.

**Explanation:**

- Many traders believe:
  - Only stocks near 52-week highs are worth trading.
  - Only stocks that “hold up very well” should be traded.
- Consequences of this belief:
  - You will miss momentum bursts that start near lows.
  - You will miss some of the biggest moves in the market.
- The instructor warns:
  - If you are “stuck in your mind” on only trading near 52-week highs, you will repeatedly miss powerful moves from lower levels.

## 4. Evidence From Recent Examples

**Main Idea:**  
Recent stock examples (viewed in TC2000/Telechart) show that large moves often start away from 52-week highs.

**Explanation:**

- When reviewing recent big movers in TC2000:
  - Many did **not** start their momentum burst near a 52-week high.
  - Example patterns described:
    - A stock where the momentum burst started away from the 52-week high and then made a 100–200% move.
    - Another stock with a momentum burst that led to a 31% move, again not starting near a 52-week high.
- Contrast with a stock like Rhythm:
  - Its move started near a 52-week high, but this is noted as **not** a momentum burst in the sense being discussed.
- Observation:
  - Momentum bursts near highs often attract many traders once the move is obvious.
  - Those “crowded” bursts near highs frequently fail.
  - In contrast, bursts near lows often produce bigger and more sustained moves.

## 5. Characteristics of a Momentum Burst

**Main Idea:**  
A momentum burst is a short-term price phenomenon that does not require the stock to be near a 52-week high.

**Explanation:**

- Timeframe:
  - A momentum burst is typically a **3 to 5 day phenomenon**.
- Requirements:
  - The stock does **not** need to be:
    - Near a 52-week high.
    - In any special position relative to its 52-week range.
  - There is no requirement that it must be at the high end of its yearly range for the burst to work.
- Flexibility:
  - Momentum bursts can start from:
    - Near 52-week lows.
    - Mid-range levels.
    - Near 52-week highs.
  - The key is the short, powerful move, not the exact 52-week position.

## 6. Practical Trading Implications

**Main Idea:**  
To fully exploit momentum bursts, traders must be willing to trade setups that start near 52-week lows.

**Explanation:**

- Actionable guidance:
  - Be ready to take momentum burst trades near lows.
  - Do not restrict your trading universe to only stocks near 52-week highs.
- Performance comparison:
  - Momentum bursts near lows:
    - Work **equally well** as those near highs.
    - In many cases, work **better** than bursts near highs.
- Risk of a narrow focus:
  - If you only trade stocks near 52-week highs:
    - You will miss a large number of valid momentum burst trades.
    - You will miss some of the biggest percentage moves (100–200% and strong 30%+ bursts).

## 7. Summary of Core Lessons

- Momentum bursts **do not** require a stock to be near its 52-week high.  
- Momentum bursts can start from **52-week lows** and can:
  - Produce very large moves (100–200% or strong 30%+ moves).
  - Often outperform bursts that start near highs.
- A momentum burst is a **3–5 day** price move and can occur from any level in the stock’s 52-week range.
- Focusing only on 52-week highs is a **limiting belief** that causes traders to miss many profitable opportunities.
- Traders should consciously include **momentum bursts near lows** in their strategy to capture more and often better trades.
