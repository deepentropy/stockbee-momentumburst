## 1. Understanding the “2 Lynch” Breakout Setup

### 1.1 Purpose of the Example
Pradeep uses an example from TC2000 to illustrate what a *good* breakout looks like according to his “2 Lynch” criteria. The goal is to help traders recognize high‑quality breakout setups and distinguish them from noisy, low‑probability patterns.

### 1.2 Visual Pattern on the Breakout Day
On the breakout day, the stock in the example shows:
- A clear prior advance (“first leg”).
- A clean, orderly pullback or consolidation.
- A narrow or slightly negative day immediately before the breakout.
- A strong breakout with the stock closing near its high.

This visual pattern is what traders should train themselves to identify.

## 2. Key Structural Elements of a Good Breakout

### 2.1 First Leg Up
- The stock must have a **first leg up** before the breakout.
- This first leg is a clear, directional move higher, establishing momentum.
- The breakout is then a continuation move after a pause, not a random spike from a flat base.

### 2.2 Orderly Pullback / Consolidation
- After the first leg, the stock should show an **orderly pullback** or **orderly consolidation**.
- “Orderly” means:
  - Price action is controlled and not erratic.
  - The pullback is relatively shallow and structured.
- This sets up the stock “very nicely” for a breakout, as it indicates controlled profit-taking rather than distribution.

### 2.3 Narrow or Negative Day Before Breakout
- The day immediately prior to the breakout should be:
  - A **narrow range day**, or
  - A **negative day** (down day), but still controlled.
- This narrow/negative day is part of the setup and is specifically highlighted as desirable for the “2 Lynch” criteria.

### 2.4 Absence of Choppiness
- **Avoid choppiness.**
- In a good setup:
  - The stock does not swing wildly up and down.
  - There are no erratic, overlapping bars that suggest indecision.
- In the example, “there is no choppiness”; the stock goes up, then consolidates cleanly, then breaks out.

## 3. Formal Criteria for the “2 Lynch” Setup

Pradeep summarizes the characteristics of the example as matching his “2 Lynch” criteria. The key elements are:

### 3.1 Linear Price Structure
- The move should be **linear**, meaning:
  - Price progresses in a relatively straight, directional manner.
  - The trend is clear, not jagged or noisy.
- This linearity applies both to the first leg and to the overall structure leading into the breakout.

### 3.2 Narrow or Negative Pre‑Breakout Day
- The **day before the breakout** should be:
  - A **narrow range day**, or
  - A **negative day** (slightly down).
- This is explicitly part of the “2 Lynch” criteria:  
  > “Linear narrow or negative day prior to breakout.”

### 3.3 Consolidation Quality and Volatility
- **Consolidation quality** is critical:
  - The pullback or consolidation must be **orderly**.
  - Volatility during this phase should be **very low**.
- Low volatility indicates:
  - Lack of panic selling.
  - Controlled behavior by market participants.
- This “orderly consolidation with a very low volatility” is a required feature.

### 3.4 4% Breakout and 4% Down Days
- Pradeep mentions:
  - “No 4% breakout.”
  - “More than one 4% rate down.”
- The key takeaway from his description is that:
  - The setup should **not** show wild 4%+ breakout spikes during the consolidation phase.
  - Multiple large (4%+) down days during the setup phase are undesirable, as they indicate instability and higher volatility.
- The example stock **met the criteria** in terms of how it behaved around these 4% moves.

### 3.5 Closing Near the High on Breakout Day
- On the breakout day itself, the stock should:
  - **Close near the high of the day.**
- A close near the high confirms:
  - Strong buying interest into the close.
  - A decisive breakout rather than a failed or faded move.

## 4. Practical Application and Example Summary

- The example stock shown in TC2000:
  - Had a clear **first leg up**.
  - Formed an **orderly, low‑volatility pullback/consolidation**.
  - Printed a **narrow or negative day** just before the breakout.
  - Avoided **choppy, erratic price action** and multiple large 4%+ down days during the setup.
  - **Closed near the high** on the breakout day.

- This combination of:
  - Linear advance,
  - Clean, low‑volatility consolidation,
  - Proper pre‑breakout day structure,
  - Strong close on breakout day,

is what defines a **high‑quality “2 Lynch” breakout setup** according to Pradeep’s criteria. Traders should focus on finding these orderly, non‑choppy patterns and avoid noisy, volatile setups that do not meet these conditions.
