## 1. Introduction: Momentum Bursts and the 200-Day Moving Average

**Key Idea:**  
The lesson addresses whether momentum burst setups work on stocks trading below their 200-day moving average, and challenges the belief that such stocks should always be avoided.

- A “momentum burst” refers to a sharp, fast price move over a short period.
- Many traders use the 200-day moving average as a major filter for deciding which stocks to trade.

## 2. Common Belief: Avoiding Stocks Below the 200-Day Moving Average

**Key Idea:**  
Some traders treat the 200-day moving average as a strict boundary and refuse to trade any stock below it.

- The 200-day moving average is often seen as a “sacrosanct line.”
- Traders who follow this belief:
  - Do not buy or trade stocks if the price is below the 200-day moving average.
  - Assume that good long setups only occur above this line.
- This mindset leads them to automatically exclude all momentum burst opportunities in stocks trading under the 200-day moving average.

## 3. Reality: Momentum Bursts Below the 200-Day Moving Average

**Key Idea:**  
Many strong and profitable momentum bursts actually occur in stocks that are below their 200-day moving average.

- Contrary to the strict 200-day rule, “many good momentum bursts actually happen below the 200-day moving average.”
- These bursts:
  - Can produce “big moves” even while the stock remains under the 200-day line.
  - Have been observed in recent market action (Pradeep mentions he can show examples from the last few days on his charting platform).
- Stocks can:
  - Trade significantly below the 200-day moving average.
  - Still generate two or three separate momentum bursts before ever reaching the 200-day line.
- Each of these bursts can be substantial:
  - “20 to 30 percent or even more” per burst.

## 4. Practical Implications for Traders

**Key Idea:**  
Momentum burst strategies are not limited to stocks above the 200-day moving average; they can be applied effectively to stocks below it as well.

- If your trading method focuses on momentum bursts (e.g., using volatility bands or similar tools), you should:
  - Recognize that valid setups occur both above and below the 200-day moving average.
  - Evaluate the quality of the momentum burst itself rather than rejecting trades solely based on the stock’s position relative to the 200-day line.
- The current environment (as referenced in the lesson):
  - Shows that “current momentum bursts on stocks” at certain price levels are “quite good,” even when those stocks are under the 200-day moving average.
- The 200-day moving average should not be treated as an absolute barrier for momentum trading opportunities.

## 5. Consequences of Ignoring Sub-200-Day Momentum Bursts

**Key Idea:**  
Refusing to trade momentum bursts below the 200-day moving average means missing significant profit opportunities.

- By the time a stock finally reaches its 200-day moving average:
  - It may already have completed multiple (2–3) momentum bursts.
  - Each burst could have delivered 20–30% or more in gains.
- If you avoid all such trades:
  - “You’re going to leave a lot of money on the table.”
  - The missed profit is a direct result of a rigid rule, not a lack of opportunity in the market.
- Psychological takeaway:
  - Do not let a dogmatic rule about the 200-day moving average prevent you from exploiting real, high-quality momentum bursts.
  - Be flexible and evidence-based: judge trades by the strength and structure of the momentum burst, not solely by the stock’s position relative to the 200-day moving average.
