## 1. Introduction

This lesson explains how to apply the 2-Lynch criteria to a 4% breakout scan in TC2000. The goal is to filter a large list of breakout candidates down to a small number of high-quality trades, improving win rate and reducing frustration.

The example used is a specific trading day (Friday) where a 4% breakout scan produced 73 stocks. The lesson shows how most of these are eliminated using 2-Lynch, leaving only a few A-quality setups.

## 2. The 2-Lynch Criteria: Definition and Components

**2-Lynch** is a set of conditions used to judge whether a breakout setup is high quality. It focuses on the behavior of price and volume before the breakout.

2-Lynch stands for:

- Not up two days in a row  
- Linearity  
- Young setup  
- Narrow or negative day prior to breakout  
- Consolidation quality should be good  
- Not more than one 4% breakdown in consolidation  
- Low volume during consolidation  
- Not a choppy consolidation  
- Volatility should decrease during consolidation  
- Stock should close near the high

Each component is used to quickly accept or reject a stock from the scan list.

### 2.1. Not Up Two Days in a Row

- The stock **should not be up two days in a row** going into the breakout.  
- If the stock is already up 2–3 days before the breakout day, it is extended and risk is higher.  
- Example: “Stock is up two days in a row… so no.”  
- Stocks up three or four days in a row are also rejected.

### 2.2. Linearity

- The **first leg up** (prior advance) should be **linear**, not choppy.  
- Linear means consistent buying with relatively smooth upward movement.  
- Choppy first legs with many sharp reversals or overlapping bars are downgraded or rejected.  
- Example: “This is a very choppy stock. So linearity is an issue… so I am not going to select that.”

### 2.3. Young Setup

- The setup should be **young**, meaning:
  - Not in the 4th or 5th leg of an extended move.
  - Preferably the **first leg** followed by a fresh consolidation and breakout.
- If the stock has already had multiple legs (first, second, third, fourth) and this would be the fifth leg, it is **not young** and is rejected.

### 2.4. Narrow or Negative Day Prior to Breakout

- The day **before the breakout** should be:
  - A **narrow range** day, or  
  - A **negative** (down) day.
- This indicates a controlled, low-volatility pause before the breakout.
- If the day before breakout is a strong up day (e.g., up 3.6%), it is a negative sign and the setup is rejected.

### 2.5. Consolidation Quality

Consolidation quality is a central part of 2-Lynch. A good consolidation:

- Is **orderly**, not wild or erratic.
- Has **no more than one 4% breakdown** during the consolidation.
- Is not a **deep pullback** that looks like a sharp correction rather than a tight base.
- Is not **all over the place** with large swings.

Bad consolidation examples:

- Multiple 4% breakdowns (e.g., “two 4% breakdowns” or “three–four percent breakdowns”).  
- Deep pullbacks instead of tight sideways action.  
- Very choppy consolidations with big up and down days.  
- High volume during consolidation (see next section).

If consolidation is poor, choppy, deep, or has multiple 4% breakdowns, the setup is rejected.

### 2.6. Low Volume During Consolidation

- During consolidation, **volume should be low**.  
- High volume in consolidation suggests distribution or lack of controlled pause.  
- Example: “There was like a volume was high during this consolidation. So it doesn’t meet 2-Lynch criteria.”

### 2.7. Decreasing Volatility in Consolidation

- Volatility should **decrease** during consolidation.  
- The stock should “quiet down” before the breakout.  
- Large, erratic bars in the base indicate poor consolidation quality and are rejected.

### 2.8. Close Near the High

- On the breakout day, the stock should **close near the high of the day**.  
- If the stock gaps up and then gives up gains, or fails to close near the high, it is rejected.  
- “Stock is not closing near the high” is repeatedly used as a reason to eliminate candidates.

## 3. The 4% Breakout Scan Setup

- The scan is run in **TC2000**.  
- Conditions:
  - **4% breakout** (price up at least 4% on the day).  
  - **Price above $3**.  
- On the example Friday, this scan produced **73 stocks**.

The scan is only the first step. Most stocks that pass the scan are not good buys. 2-Lynch is used to filter them.

## 4. Applying 2-Lynch to the 4% Breakout Scan

### 4.1. Using 2-Lynch to Rapidly Eliminate Weak Setups

The process:

1. Run the 4% breakout scan.
2. Go through each stock **quickly**, using 2-Lynch as a checklist.
3. Eliminate stocks immediately when:
   - Up 2+ days in a row.
   - Multiple 4% breakdowns in consolidation.
   - Choppy or deep consolidation.
   - High volume in consolidation.
   - Not closing near the high.
   - Setup is not young (many prior legs).
   - Stock is in a clear downtrend.

Using this method, **80–95%** of the stocks from the scan are eliminated. Only a few A-quality setups remain.

### 4.2. Examples of Rejected Setups and Why They Fail

Below are typical reasons used in the lesson to reject stocks:

- **Up multiple days in a row**:
  - “Stock is up two days in a row… so no.”
  - “Stock is now up three days almost… this is the third day of a swing… so no.”
  - “Stock is up four days in a row… so that is not a good breakout.”

- **Multiple 4% breakdowns in consolidation**:
  - “There are two 4% breakdowns… am I going to select this? No.”
  - “Consolidation has two 4% breakdowns… so this is not a good candidate.”
  - “Two 4% breakdown itself is a killer.”

- **Choppy or poor consolidation**:
  - “This is a very choppy stock… linearity is an issue.”
  - “This is not an orderly consolidation.”
  - “Consolidation is very choppy.”
  - “Consolidation is all over the place.”
  - “Deep consolidation… very choppy consolidation… not a good setup.”

- **High volume during consolidation**:
  - “There was like a volume was high during this consolidation. So it doesn’t meet 2-Lynch criteria.”
  - “One big high volume down day in this consolidation… so answer is no.”

- **Not closing near the high**:
  - “Stock is not closing near the high… so automatically it goes.”
  - “Gapping up and giving up the gains, not closing near high… eliminate.”

- **Not young / too many legs**:
  - “First leg, second leg, third leg, fourth leg, this will be a fifth leg. So is it young? No.”

- **Downtrend**:
  - “Stock is in a downtrend actually… so no.”
  - “This is in a downtrend… and not closing near the high also.”

These criteria are applied quickly, often rejecting a stock after just one or two clear violations.

### 4.3. Examples of Accepted Setups and Why They Qualify

A few stocks from the scan **did** meet 2-Lynch criteria. Key characteristics:

1. **Example 1 (unnamed individual stock)**  
   - First leg was **very linear**.  
   - **Orderly pullback** with:
     - No 4% breakdown.
     - Low volume during pullback.
   - Breakout day:
     - Stock is **breaking out**.
     - **Closing near the high**.  
   - This is identified as a valid candidate.

2. **Another candidate (individual stock)**  
   - First leg with **continuous buying**.  
   - **Orderly pullback**, not a major pullback.  
   - Pullback was **hardly 3%**.  
   - Breakout day:
     - **Breaking out**.
     - **Closing near high**.  
   - Meets 2-Lynch and is considered a good candidate.

3. **ECH (ETF)**  
   - First leg with **consistent buying for 4–5 days**.  
   - **Orderly pullback**.  
   - **Negative or narrow range day** before breakout.  
   - Breakout day:
     - **Closing near the high**.  
   - Meets 2-Lynch and is selected.

4. **BCH (stock)**  
   - **Continuous buying** in the first leg.  
   - **Orderly pullback**, not a major pullback.  
   - Breakout day:
     - **Breaking out**.
     - **Closing near high**.  
   - Meets 2-Lynch and is selected.

These are described as **A-quality setups** that fully meet the 2-Lynch criteria.

## 5. A-, B-, and C-Quality Setups

The lesson distinguishes between quality levels:

- **A-quality setups**:
  - Fully meet 2-Lynch criteria.
  - Clean, linear first leg.
  - Orderly, low-volume consolidation.
  - No more than one 4% breakdown.
  - Young setup.
  - Close near the high.
  - These are the setups you **should** trade.

- **B- or C-quality setups**:
  - Have issues such as:
    - Choppy first leg.
    - Choppy consolidation.
    - Not closing near the high.
    - Multiple breakdowns.
  - Example: “This is a B category, C category setup… maybe kind of a setup unless somebody is putting gun to your head. I would not say that you should buy a setup like this.”
  - These are **not recommended**. Trading them leads to lower win rates and frustration.

The core advice: **Only select A-quality setups** that meet 2-Lynch. Avoid B and C setups even if they sometimes work.

## 6. Practical Workflow: How to Use 2-Lynch Daily

The methodology described:

1. **Run the 4% breakout scan** in TC2000:
   - Condition: 4% breakout.
   - Price > $3.

2. **As soon as stocks start showing up**, go through them one by one.

3. **Apply 2-Lynch criteria**:
   - Check:
     - Not up 2+ days in a row.
     - Linearity of first leg.
     - Young setup (not many prior legs).
     - Narrow/negative day before breakout.
     - Consolidation quality:
       - Orderly.
       - No more than one 4% breakdown.
       - Low volume.
       - Decreasing volatility.
       - Not choppy or deep.
     - Breakout day closes near the high.

4. **Eliminate 80–95% of stocks**:
   - Most stocks will fail on one or more criteria.
   - Quickly discard them and move on.

5. **Select only those that meet all criteria**:
   - These are your **A-quality** candidates.
   - Once a stock meets all your criteria, it becomes a valid trade idea.

## 7. Key Takeaways and Psychological Advice

- When you apply 2-Lynch to a 4% breakout list, **about 95%** of setups will not meet your criteria.
- This is **normal and desired**: the goal is to be highly selective.
- The “trick” to having a **higher win rate** in breakout trading is:
  - **Only select A-quality setups** that meet 2-Lynch.
  - **Do not trade** B- or C-quality setups.
- If you ignore 2-Lynch and trade lower-quality breakouts:
  - You will likely be **frustrated** with the breakout method.
- The process is simple:
  - Run the scan.
  - Apply 2-Lynch.
  - Select only those that meet all criteria.
  - Stop there.

This disciplined filtering is the core of the lesson and the key to improving breakout trading performance.
