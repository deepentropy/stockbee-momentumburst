## 1. Understanding “Young” vs “Old” Setups in 4% Breakouts

### 1.1 Definition of a “Leg” in a Move
- A “leg” refers to a distinct upward move in the stock’s price within a trend.  
- The sequence is typically described as:
  - First leg  
  - Second leg  
  - Third leg  
  - Fourth leg, etc.  
- Each leg is usually followed by some form of consolidation or pullback before the next leg begins.

### 1.2 What Makes a Setup “Young”
- A setup is considered “young” when:
  - The stock is in its first or second leg of the move.  
  - The breakout is occurring early in the overall trend.  
- In the example described:
  - The stock has a strong first leg.  
  - It then forms an orderly consolidation or pullback.  
  - The breakout from this early consolidation is a “young” setup.

### 1.3 What Makes a Setup “Old”
- A setup is considered “old” when:
  - The stock is in its third, fourth, or later leg of the move.  
  - The stock has already made a big move and is widely recognized.  
- By the fourth leg:
  - The stock is often well known.  
  - “Everybody’s eyes are on it.”  
  - The breakout is obvious to many market participants.  
- Such later-stage breakouts are no longer “young” setups.

## 2. Why Younger Setups Have Higher Probability

### 2.1 Failure Rates in Later Legs
- As the number of legs increases, the probability of failure rises:
  - “Typically the older the setup becomes, more is the rate of failures.”  
- Fourth, fifth, or sixth leg breakouts:
  - Tend to have lower win rates.  
  - Are more likely to fail compared to first or second leg setups.

### 2.2 Profit-Taking Pressure on Obvious Breakouts
- When a stock has already made a large move:
  - The breakout becomes obvious and attracts a lot of attention.  
  - Many traders are already in the stock with profits.  
- These obvious, late-stage breakouts:
  - Often attract profit-taking rather than fresh, strong buying.  
  - This profit-taking can cause the breakout to fail or stall.

## 3. Ideal Setup Characteristics in the 4% Breakout Method

### 3.1 First Leg Followed by Orderly Consolidation
- A good 4% breakout setup typically shows:
  - A clear first leg of the move.  
  - Followed by an orderly consolidation or pullback (not wild or erratic).  
  - Then a breakout from this consolidation.  
- This structure indicates:
  - Early-stage momentum.  
  - Controlled, healthy pause before continuation.

### 3.2 The “Two-Leg” Context for a Good Setup
- Ideal setups often appear:
  - After the first leg has been established.  
  - When the first “tool-inch” (two-leg) type setup shows up.  
- In this context:
  - The stock has proven it can move (first leg).  
  - The consolidation sets up the second leg.  
  - The breakout is still early in the overall move, keeping the setup “young.”

### 3.3 Future Focus: Finding the First Leg with 4% Breakouts
- Beyond trading the second leg:
  - It is also possible to identify and trade the first leg itself using the 4% breakout method.  
- This is mentioned as a future topic:
  - “Later we are going to see how you can find even the first leg of the move itself by another kind of a setup using four percent breakout.”  
- The key idea:
  - There are specific 4% breakout setups that can capture the very beginning of the move, not just the second leg.

## 4. Practical Guidelines for Selecting Setups

### 4.1 Prefer Young, Early-Stage Moves
- Core principle:
  - “Younger the setup, better it is.”  
- Focus on:
  - First or second leg breakouts.  
  - Early consolidations after an initial strong move.  
- These have:
  - Higher probability of success.  
  - Better odds of producing profitable trades.

### 4.2 Avoid Late, Crowded, “Everybody’s Watching” Moves
- Be cautious when:
  - The stock is on its fourth, fifth, or sixth leg.  
  - The stock is widely followed and “everybody is excited about consolidation.”  
- In such cases:
  - The breakout is more likely to fail.  
  - Profit-taking pressure is higher.  
  - Your win rate will tend to decrease if you repeatedly buy these late-stage breakouts.

### 4.3 Summary Rule to Remember
- Always remember:
  - Look for younger setups in the 4% breakout method.  
  - Avoid obvious, late-stage breakouts after big moves.  
- Practical rule:
  - Ideal: First leg established, then an orderly consolidation, then breakout (early in the move).  
  - Risky: Fourth, fifth, sixth leg breakouts that are obvious and crowded.  
- Applying this nuance consistently:
  - Improves your probability of making money with the 4% breakout setup.
