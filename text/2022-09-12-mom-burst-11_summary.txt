## 1. Applicability of Momentum Burst Across Global Markets

### 1.1. Momentum Works in Most Markets

- Momentum and momentum burst patterns are not limited to the US market.  
- In the vast majority of the approximately 130 countries with stock markets, stock price movement still follows momentum-based behavior.  
- If you examine charts from any of these markets, you will see stocks moving in ways that are consistent with momentum burst concepts.

### 1.2. Evidence from International Traders

- Traders from multiple countries have reported using the momentum burst method successfully in their local markets.  
- These traders have taken the same core method and applied it outside the US, confirming that the approach is broadly applicable.  
- This includes markets such as:
  - Great Britain  
  - European countries  
  - Korea  
  - China  
  - Singapore  
  - Malaysia  
  - And many other countries with functioning stock markets

## 2. Exceptions and Market Structure Constraints

### 2.1. Price Filters and Trading Halts

- Some countries have specific rules that can interfere with momentum trading, particularly:
  - **Price filters / daily limits**: For example, if a stock is up 5% in a day, trading in that stock may be halted or restricted for the rest of the day.  
- In such markets, momentum burst strategies become difficult to execute because:
  - The stock cannot continue its move beyond the imposed limit.  
  - You cannot freely enter or exit once the filter is triggered.

### 2.2. Impact of Regulatory Rules on Momentum Burst

- These issues are not due to momentum burst as a concept failing, but due to **regulatory constraints** in those specific markets.  
- Based on feedback from members, such restrictive environments appear to be relatively rare:
  - Only one or two countries reported this as a significant problem.  
- In most other markets, there are no such severe daily price limits that would prevent momentum burst trading.

## 3. Adapting Momentum Burst to Local Conditions

### 3.1. Core Concept Remains the Same

- The fundamental idea of momentum burst is universal:
  - Stocks move in bursts of momentum across different markets.  
  - The pattern of sharp, short-term moves is visible on charts regardless of country.  
- As long as there is a functioning stock market with freely traded stocks, the basic behavior that momentum burst exploits will be present.

### 3.2. Adjusting Volume and Price Filters

- While the core concept is the same, **implementation details may need adjustment**:
  - **Volume filters**: You may need to modify minimum volume requirements to match typical liquidity levels in your market.  
  - **Price perception / price filters**: You may need to adjust:
    - What you consider a meaningful price move (e.g., % move thresholds).  
    - Any filters related to stock price levels (e.g., avoiding very low-priced stocks if that fits your market’s structure).  

### 3.3. Country-Specific Customization

- Because each market has its own:
  - Liquidity profile  
  - Typical volatility  
  - Regulatory environment  
- You should:
  - Understand the momentum burst concept thoroughly.  
  - Then adapt:
    - Volume filters  
    - Price filters  
    - Any perception-based thresholds  
  - To fit the characteristics and rules of your specific country.  
- Many traders outside the US have successfully done this and are profitably using momentum burst in their local markets.
