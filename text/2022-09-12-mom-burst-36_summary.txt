## 1. Types of Stops in Trading

### 1.1 Mental Stops
- Mental stops are price levels a trader keeps in mind without placing an actual stop order in the system.  
- Execution depends on the trader manually exiting when the price reaches that level.

### 1.2 Hard Stops
- Hard stops are real stop orders entered into the trading system.  
- They are automatically triggered when the price hits the specified level.  
- They do not rely on the trader’s discretion at the moment of loss.

## 2. Pradeep Bond’s Preferred Approach

### 2.1 Why He Uses Hard Stops
- Pradeep explicitly states he is not a fan of mental stops and uses hard stops.  
- Hard stops:
  - Are “real stops” placed in the system.
  - Enforce discipline by automatically taking the loss at the predetermined level.
  - Remove the need for emotional decision-making in the moment.

### 2.2 Problems With Mental Stops
- Mental stops make it easy to:
  - Avoid taking losses at the right time.
  - Rationalize delaying the exit.
  - Fail to move or honor stops as planned.  
- Because of this, he does not recommend mental stops and does not use them himself.

## 3. Myths and Misconceptions About Stops

### 3.1 “Market Makers Gun for Your Stops”
- Many traders believe:
  - Market makers target their stop orders.
  - Their small positions are being hunted.

### 3.2 Pradeep’s View on Conspiracy Theories
- He does not subscribe to these conspiracy theories.  
- His reasoning:
  - If a market maker is so focused on targeting small orders (e.g., 1,000–5,000 shares), that market maker is likely to go out of business.  
  - Market makers have more important tasks than trying to hit small retail stops.  
- Conclusion: Fear of stop-hunting should not prevent traders from using hard stops.

## 4. When Stops Should Be Active

### 4.1 Market Hours vs. Pre-Market and After-Hours
- Pradeep’s stops:
  - Are active only during regular market hours.
  - Are not active in pre-market or after-hours trading.  
- He does not recommend placing stops that can be triggered outside regular hours.

### 4.2 Liquidity and Partial Fills
- In pre-market and after-hours:
  - Liquidity is very low.
  - Spreads can be wide and trading is thin.  
- Risks of having stops active in these sessions:
  - You may lose a lot of money due to poor fills.
  - You may receive partial fills, leaving you with an undesirable remaining position.

### 4.3 Carrying Stops Overnight
- Pradeep’s practice:
  - He has been trading for 22 years using this approach.
  - He is comfortable placing stops and carrying them to the next day.
  - The stops only become active and executable during regular market hours.  
- Key point: It is acceptable to carry hard stops overnight as long as they are set to work only during the day session.

## 5. Practical Implementation Guidelines

- Use hard stops, not mental stops:
  - Enter actual stop orders into the system.
  - Let them enforce your risk management automatically.
- Configure stops to be active only during regular market hours:
  - Do not allow stops to trigger in pre-market or after-hours sessions.
- Avoid after-hours and pre-market stop activation:
  - To reduce the risk of large slippage and partial fills due to low liquidity.
- Maintain discipline:
  - Do not rely on memory or emotion to exit losing trades.
  - Use system-based hard stops to ensure consistent execution of your plan.
