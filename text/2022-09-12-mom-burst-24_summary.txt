## 1. Tool-Inch Concept and Core Importance

The central idea in this lesson is the **“tool-inch” condition**, which is a set of criteria used to evaluate whether a breakout setup is high quality.

- The **most important skill** is the ability to **select setups that meet all tool-inch criteria**.  
- Only setups that satisfy these criteria are considered valid **tool-inch setups** and are preferred for trading.

## 2. Example Setup: Structure of the Breakout

Pradeep uses a specific stock example from the last month that appeared in his scan and then broke out. He walks through how this stock illustrates a proper tool-inch setup.

### 2.1 First Leg and Linearity

- The chart shows a **clear first leg up** before consolidation.  
- This first leg has **linearity**, meaning:
  - The move is **strong and directional**, not choppy.
  - There is **strong buying** in this initial move.

### 2.2 Three-Day Consolidation

- After the first leg, the stock enters a **three-day consolidation**:
  - Price action tightens and **holds the gains** from the first leg.
  - The consolidation is described as **good quality**:
    - No major breakdowns.
    - The stock maintains most of the prior advance.

### 2.3 4% Breakdown Rule and Small Up Day

- During the consolidation:
  - There is **no 4% breakdown** on any day. This is critical:
    - A 4% or greater drop during consolidation would violate tool-inch criteria.
  - One of the days in consolidation is **up only 0.52%**:
    - Some might say the stock is “up two days in a row,” but:
      - Pradeep treats this 0.52% day as effectively **flat or negligible**.
      - It does **not** invalidate the consolidation.
      - He even notes one day was effectively **down**, reinforcing that this is essentially a **one-day up** move, not an extended run.

### 2.4 Breakout Day Behavior and Close

- On the breakout day:
  - The stock moves **4%+** (meets the 4% breakout requirement).  
  - It **does not close exactly at the high**, but:
    - It **does not give up most of the gains**.
    - It **maintains the bulk of the day’s advance**.
- Even though the close is not at the absolute high, the behavior is still acceptable and considered a **good breakout** within tool-inch criteria.

## 3. Evaluating the Setup Against Tool-Inch Criteria

Pradeep explicitly checks the example against tool-inch conditions:

- **Linearity in the first leg?**  
  Yes – strong, clean buying in the initial move.
  
- **Consolidation quality?**  
  Yes – three days of consolidation, holding gains, no major breakdown.

- **Any 4% breakdown during consolidation?**  
  No – this is essential; a 4% breakdown would disqualify the setup.

- **Narrow or negative day acceptable?**  
  Yes – the 0.52% day is considered narrow and acceptable; it does not count as a problematic “up” day.

- **Breakout of 4%+?**  
  Yes – the stock breaks out more than 4%.

- **Close near high required?**  
  Not strictly at the high, but:
  - The stock must **not give up most of the gains**.
  - Maintaining the bulk of the breakout move is sufficient.

Because it meets all these points, this is labeled a **good tool-inch setup**.

## 4. Young Setups vs. Later-Leg Setups

Pradeep emphasizes that this example is a **“young setup”**:

- It is **not** a second or third leg of an extended move.  
- The stock had gone **sideways for almost a month** before starting this leg.
- The current move is:
  - Either the **first leg** of a new advance, or  
  - The **second part of the first leg**, still early in the overall move.

He stresses that traders should **prefer these young setups** over later-leg moves, as they typically offer better risk-reward and cleaner behavior.

## 5. Practical Takeaway: What to Look For in 4% Breakouts

From this lesson, the practical checklist for a valid 4% breakout under tool-inch conditions is:

1. **Strong, linear first leg** with clear buying pressure.  
2. **Good-quality consolidation**:
   - Typically a few days (e.g., three days).
   - Holds most of the prior gains.
   - No **4% breakdown** during this period.
   - Small or negligible up days (like 0.52%) are acceptable.
3. **Breakout of 4%+** from the consolidation.  
4. **Close that maintains most of the breakout gains**, even if not at the exact high.  
5. Preference for **young setups**:
   - Not in the second or third extended leg.
   - Often following a period of sideways action.

The key skill is to **consistently select setups that match these tool-inch criteria**, focusing on young, clean 4% breakout patterns like the example described.
