## 1. Tool Inch Setup: Concept and Structure

### 1.1. First Leg of the Move
- The setup begins with a **strong first leg up** in the stock.
- This first leg should show **good linearity** (a relatively smooth, persistent upward move without wild swings).
- The strength and clarity of this first leg are important because they set the context for the next phase.

### 1.2. Sideways Reset Phase
- After the first leg, the stock goes **sideways** for a period.
- In the example, the stock moved sideways for **about a month**.
- This sideways action acts as a **reset**:
  - It allows the prior move to be digested.
  - It refreshes the setup so that the next move can be treated as a **new first leg**.

### 1.3. Second Leg and Breakout Characteristics
- After the sideways reset, a **new leg** starts from the consolidation.
- The breakout from this consolidation is what defines the **tool inch setup**:
  - The breakout day should be **orderly** and **near the high of the day**.
  - The structure of this second leg should resemble the first leg in terms of **linearity and strength**.

## 2. Technical Criteria for a Valid Tool Inch Setup

### 2.1. Sideways Consolidation Duration
- A key element is a **sideways move lasting about a month or more**.
- This duration is enough for the stock to **reset itself**:
  - The prior move is absorbed.
  - The stock is ready for a fresh leg that can be traded as a new opportunity.

### 2.2. Price Action During Consolidation
- The consolidation should be **orderly**:
  - No **4% breakdown** days during the consolidation.
  - No **two consecutive strong up days** (e.g., not up significantly two days in a row).
- Small up days during consolidation are acceptable:
  - Example given: a day up **0.69%** (about **10–18 cents**) is considered a **positive day**, but not a strong breakout.
- The idea is that the stock is **resting**, not already breaking out or breaking down.

### 2.3. Breakout Day Requirements
- On the breakout day:
  - The stock should be **breaking out of the consolidation range**.
  - It should **close near the high of the day**, showing strength into the close.
  - The move is typically around **5% up** on that day in the example.
- The breakout should be **clean and decisive**, not a weak or mid-range close.

### 2.4. Volume Confirmation
- Volume is a critical confirmation:
  - On the breakout day, there should be **big volume** coming into the stock.
  - This confirms that the move is supported by **strong participation**.
- The combination of **price strength (around 5% up)** and **high volume** is a hallmark of a good tool inch setup.

## 3. Importance of Linearity in the Move

- **Linearity** refers to a **smooth, consistent upward move** without erratic spikes or deep pullbacks.
- The first leg should show **strong linearity**, and the second leg (after consolidation) should also display similar linearity.
- When both the initial move and the breakout leg are linear:
  - The setup is considered **high quality**.
  - It fits well into the **tool inch** criteria and is more reliable as a breakout trade.

## 4. Practice, Pattern Study, and Skill Development

### 4.1. Building a Personal Library of Setups
- Extensive **example study** is emphasized:
  - Study **300, 400, 500** or more examples of tool inch setups.
- Pradeep’s own practice:
  - When he started trading **20–22 years ago**, he compiled around **1,000 examples** of such setups for himself.
- This personal library becomes a **reference book of ideal setups**.

### 4.2. Daily Review and Pattern Matching
- He used to go through his **book of setups multiple times a day**.
- The process:
  - Review historical ideal setups repeatedly.
  - In real time, look for current market setups that **look similar** to those ideal examples.
- This constant comparison trains the eye to **recognize high-quality breakouts quickly**.

### 4.3. How Repetition Improves Real-Time Trading
- The more work you do in studying examples, the **easier it becomes in real time** to:
  - Identify a **good breakout**.
  - Distinguish between **high-quality** and **low-quality** setups.
- The key psychological and practical advice:
  - **Repetition and deliberate study** of many examples is essential.
  - Over time, this builds **clarity and confidence** in executing tool inch setups in live markets.
