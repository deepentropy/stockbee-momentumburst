 Do you need to trade high ADR stocks for momentum burst to work? The answer is no. A stock can be having a low ADR before a momentum burst start and as soon as momentum burst happens, it is going to have high ADR. So, lot of people want to trade only stocks which have a certain ADR. Now, suddenly a stock has a momentum burst. When suddenly a stock has a momentum burst, what happens to the ADR once a momentum burst happens? What do you think happened to the ADR of a stock like this when momentum burst happened? And is the past ADR of this stock really relevant? The moment this happened, its ADR increased, right? If you look at many of the stocks which make this big move, their past ADR doesn't really matter because as soon as big momentum burst happens, the ADR explodes. The past ADR is a very backward looking thing. It doesn't tell you what is going to happen in the future. As soon as you get a momentum burst, your ADR is going to go up. Now, if you are only sorting stocks by some low ADR, high ADR kind of a thing, this stock may not appear on your scan on this particular day because you pre-decided that you are not going to be trading stocks with low ADR. But that is in the past. That is what was happening to the stock before it had a momentum burst. As soon as the momentum burst, the reality of the stock changed and it will have a high ADR. So you are going to miss out on a lot of moves because you have this fascination for high ADR stocks. In fact, on stocks, we will have a low ADR before a momentum burst. And then, by very definition, momentum burst is a range expansion. The moment there is a range expansion, the ADR explodes. So this is something which you should think through and which you should study on the stocks, especially for some of you, who are hell-bent on just like any using ADR without really understanding. Look, ADR changes or ADR is going to explode the moment there is a momentum burst. So if you have an ADR kind of a mentality, you are going to miss out on many first, second legs of moves where the stock, pre their momentum burst, might be having a low ADR. So think twice before eliminating stocks which have low ADR. Mark your travels. It is описied for the market market that you pay studies without seeing aרי cardboard out of state auctions. And so letters are best leveraged on this kind of easy to read job. This will come down to this question.
