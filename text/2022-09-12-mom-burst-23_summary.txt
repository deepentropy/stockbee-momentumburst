## 1. Pattern Recognition in Momentum Burst Trading

### 1.1. Trading as a Pattern Recognition Game
- The method described is based on recognizing a recurring price/volume pattern.  
- The objective is to train your brain so that this pattern becomes instantly recognizable on a chart.

### 1.2. The Goal: Instant Breakout Identification
- As soon as you see a chart, you should be able to quickly decide whether it is a “good breakout” that fits the momentum burst setup.  
- Developing this instant recognition is a key trading skill for this style.

## 2. The “Tool Inch” Momentum Burst Setup

### 2.1. Overview of the Setup
- The setup is referred to as “tool inch” in the lesson.  
- It is a specific type of momentum burst pattern with clearly defined conditions.  
- You should focus on finding setups that meet *all* of these conditions.

### 2.2. First Leg of the Breakout
- The pattern starts with a **first leg of the breakout**:
  - A strong initial move up in price.
  - This leg establishes momentum and direction.

### 2.3. Consolidation Phase Requirements
After the first leg, the stock enters a **consolidation**:

- There may be a **negative day** during consolidation, but:
  - The stock **should not have a 4% breakdown** (no large, sharp drop).
  - The **volume should not be high** on the negative day.
- This indicates a normal, controlled pause rather than a failure of the move.

### 2.4. Pre-Breakout Day Characteristics
- Just before the breakout, the stock typically shows:
  - A **narrower negative day** (small down day).
  - This day can be around **0% to slightly negative** (flat to mildly down).
- This narrow, quiet day sets up the next breakout by showing reduced selling pressure and tight price action.

### 2.5. Breakout Day Characteristics
- On the breakout day:
  - The stock **breaks out of the consolidation**.
  - The **stock closes near the high of the day**.
- A close near the high confirms strength and follow-through of the momentum burst.

## 3. Practical Application

### 3.1. Using TC2000 to View the Setup
- The example is demonstrated using **TC2000** charting software.  
- On the day of the breakout, the chart will show:
  - The first leg up.
  - A consolidation with acceptable negative days (no 4% breakdown, no high volume).
  - A narrow negative or flat day just before the breakout.
  - A breakout candle closing near the high.

### 3.2. Daily Focus: Searching for Qualified Setups
- Every trading day, you should:
  - **Actively scan** for setups that look like this pattern.
  - **Focus only on setups that meet these criteria** rather than random breakouts.
- Consistent attention to this specific pattern helps build the pattern recognition skill necessary for trading this momentum burst setup effectively.
