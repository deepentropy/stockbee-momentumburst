## 1. Overview of the Lesson

This lesson focuses on identifying a high-quality “tool inch” breakout setup using TC2000 charts. Pradeep explains how to evaluate a breakout on the day it occurs and provides a checklist of conditions that define an ideal setup. The emphasis is on pattern quality and disciplined selection to improve the probability of success in 4% breakout trades.

## 2. The “Tool Inch” Breakout Setup

### 2.1. Purpose of the Example

- The example is taken from a past chart in TC2000 (a breakout that occurred weeks or months ago).  
- The goal is to show how a good “tool inch” setup should look **on the day of the breakout**.  
- This example serves as a **template** for what traders should look for in real time.

### 2.2. Checklist for a Good Tool Inch Breakout

On the breakout day, the setup should meet the following criteria:

1. **Not up two days in a row** before the breakout.  
2. **Linearity**: strong, persistent buying in the prior move.  
3. **Good consolidation quality**:  
   - No 4% breakdown during consolidation.  
   - Orderly, controlled price action.  
4. **Young setup**:  
   - The stock has had a **first leg up**.  
   - The breakout is starting the **second leg**, not the fourth, fifth, or sixth.  
5. **Narrow or negative day prior to breakout**:  
   - The day before the breakout is either a small-range day or a down day.  
6. **Closing near the high** on the breakout day.  

When all these boxes are ticked, the setup qualifies as a strong “tool inch” breakout candidate.

## 3. Key Characteristics of an Ideal Breakout

### 3.1. Not Up Two Days in a Row

- The stock should **not** be already up for two consecutive days before the breakout.  
- This avoids chasing extended short-term moves and reduces the risk of buying into exhaustion.

### 3.2. Linearity and Persistent Buying

- The prior advance (first leg) should show **strong, persistent buying**.  
- Price should move in a relatively straight, directional manner (good **linearity**), indicating strong demand and trend strength.

### 3.3. Consolidation Quality

- After the first leg, the stock should enter an **orderly consolidation**:  
  - No sharp drops or **4% breakdowns** within the base.  
  - Price action is controlled, without wild swings.  
- Good consolidation suggests healthy digestion of gains and sets up a cleaner second leg.

### 3.4. Young Setup (Early in the Move)

- The breakout should be part of a **young setup**:  
  - The stock has completed a **first leg** and is now starting the **second leg**.  
  - Avoid setups that are in their **fourth, fifth, or sixth leg**, as they are more mature and riskier.  

### 3.5. Narrow or Negative Day Before Breakout

- The day immediately before the breakout should be:  
  - A **narrow-range day** (small candle), or  
  - A **negative day** (down close).  
- This often indicates short-term pause or shakeout, which can precede a strong breakout.

### 3.6. Closing Near the High on Breakout Day

- On the breakout day, the stock should **close near the high of the day**.  
- This shows strong buying pressure into the close and confirms the breakout strength.

## 4. Using the Template to Improve Breakout Trading

### 4.1. Why Template Matching Matters

- The example described (first leg, orderly consolidation, breakout near high, narrow/negative day before, not up two days in a row) is an **ideal template**.  
- Consistently looking for setups that match this template will **significantly improve** the probability of success in trading 4% breakouts.

### 4.2. Impact of Poor Setup Selection

- If you **make mistakes in selecting setups** and enter **choppy, low-quality patterns**, your trading results will also be **choppy**.  
- Poor pattern quality directly translates into inconsistent performance.

### 4.3. Daily Practice: Selecting Only High-Quality Setups

- Each day, focus on finding setups that **look like the ideal example**:  
  - First leg up  
  - Orderly consolidation  
  - Breakout near high  
  - Narrow/negative day before breakout  
  - Not up two days in a row  
  - Young setup (second leg)  
- If you **only** select and trade setups that meet these criteria, you will:  
  - Have **no difficulty** finding good breakouts.  
  - Improve your overall trading consistency and results.
