 When you trade 4% breakout methods, adding filter is a good way to reduce the number of stocks which are showing up in your scale. Now, if you want absolutely big returns, then you have to trade smaller stocks. But if you are one of the person who is working or you don't have time to look after your breakouts and manage stocks dynamically or you want to do slower rate trading, then one of the filters or one of the things which you can do, and I'll show you using my TC2000 thing, is to run the breakout scan itself on stocks which are... Now here, when we are running this breakout scan, we are running it on US Common Stocks, American Repository Receipt, Exchange Traded Fund. So this is running it on around 6,000 or more, almost around 8,000 or 9,000 or more like Exchange Traded Fund itself. There might be 3,000. So you're like using a much wider universe. So in order to reduce the complexity, this is more like for people who don't want to trade very small stocks. They only want larger stocks and all. Then you remove all these and only add index components. So you add NASDAQ 100, you add S&P 500, and you add Dow Jones 30. Even if you don't add Dow Jones 30, every single component of Dow Jones 30 is also a member of... Already. Already the index, right? S&P 500. So here, if you add this, what you're going to get is you're going to get very few ideas, right? This is very restrictive filter. You're going to get very few number of trades. But this is more suitable if you are like looking for larger cap kind of ideas and only focusing on larger cap kind of trades, basically. So index filtering is one of the things in which if you are a working person or like in a very busy... And you still want to trade methods like this, then you can use index component as your base filter. And then you run this particular scan on that index component kind of things. Thank you.
