 Another example of 2 Lynch which I am going to show you which will help you understand what to look for in a good breakout. So in order to do that let's again try and go to TC2000 and see in TC2000 a stock which looked like this on the breakout day. So again look at it. You have the first leg. You have very orderly pullback right and this is a narrow or negative day and the stock is breaking out. Those are the kind of setups you want to find and avoid choppiness. There is no choppiness here. The stock has gone up here and sets up very nicely for a breakout. So these kind of setups is what the criteria to use is 2 Lynch. Not up to raise. Linear narrow or negative day prior to breakout. Consolidation quality, orderly pullback or orderly consolidation with a very low volatility. No 4% breakout. More than one 4% rate down and then the stock closing near the high. All those criteria this stock met on the day of the breakout.
