## 1. Overview of the 4% Breakout/Breakdown Concept

The 4% breakout/breakdown scan is designed to identify **range expansion** moves in stocks—either strong upward moves (bullish breakouts) or strong downward moves (bearish breakdowns)—on **high volume**.

- A **4% breakout** looks for stocks up at least 4% on higher-than-usual volume.  
- A **4% breakdown** looks for stocks down at least 4% on higher-than-usual volume.  
- Both sides use volume filters to ensure the move is significant and tradable.

These scans are used to find potential **start of momentum bursts**, not every stock that moves slightly.

## 2. Bullish 4% Breakout: Definition and Conditions

A **bullish 4% breakout** identifies stocks making a strong upward move with confirming volume.

### 2.1. Exact Scan Criteria

For a stock to qualify as a **bullish 4% breakout**, it must meet all three conditions:

1. **Price Move**:  
   - The stock is **up 4% or more** for the day.

2. **Volume vs. Previous Day**:  
   - **Today’s volume > yesterday’s volume**.

3. **Minimum Liquidity**:  
   - **Today’s volume > 100,000 shares**.

If all three conditions are met, the stock will appear in the bullish 4% breakout scan.

### 2.2. Example of a Bullish 4% Breakout

On the example Friday used in the lesson:

- The scan was run on:
  - US common stocks  
  - Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)  
  - American Depository Receipts (ADRs)

- **127 stocks** met the 4% breakout conditions.

Example stock from that day:

- Price change: **+7.91%** (greater than 4%)  
- Today’s volume: **5.2 million**  
- Yesterday’s volume: **1.2 million**  
- Today’s volume is:
  - Greater than yesterday’s volume  
  - Greater than 100,000 shares  

Because it satisfies all three criteria, it appears in the **bullish breakout scan**.

## 3. Bearish 4% Breakdown: Definition and Conditions

A **bearish 4% breakdown** identifies stocks making a strong downward move with confirming volume.

### 3.1. Exact Scan Criteria

For a stock to qualify as a **bearish 4% breakdown**, it must meet all three conditions:

1. **Price Move**:  
   - The stock is **down 4% or more** for the day.

2. **Volume vs. Previous Day**:  
   - **Today’s volume > yesterday’s volume**.

3. **Minimum Liquidity**:  
   - **Today’s volume > 100,000 shares**.

If all three conditions are met, the stock will appear in the bearish 4% breakdown scan.

*(Note: In the transcription, “3%” is mentioned repeatedly in one line, but the scan being described is clearly the same 4% breakdown scan with the conditions above.)*

### 3.2. Example of a Bearish 4% Breakdown

On the same example Friday:

- **148 stocks** met the 4% breakdown conditions.

Example stock from that day:

- Price change: **–8%** (down more than 4%)  
- Today’s volume: **599,000 shares**  
- Yesterday’s volume: **337,000 shares**  
- Today’s volume is:
  - Greater than yesterday’s volume  
  - Greater than 100,000 shares  

This stock is a clear example of a **bearish breakdown** and appears in the 4% breakdown scan.

## 4. Range Expansion and Momentum Burst

The 4% breakout/breakdown scans are fundamentally **range expansion** scans:

- They look for days where the stock’s price moves significantly (≥ 4%) compared to its recent behavior.
- When a stock appears in these scans and **did not have a similar breakout/breakdown yesterday or the day before**, it often indicates:
  - A **new range expansion**, or  
  - The **start of a momentum burst**.

However:

- **Not all stocks** that show up in the scan will be suitable trades.
- The scan is a **starting point** to find candidates; further filters and rules are needed for actual entries and exits.

## 5. Using the 4% Breakout/Breakdown Scan in TC2000

The lesson demonstrates using these scans in **TC2000**:

- The same bullish scan described is implemented in TC2000 and run on:
  - US common stocks  
  - ETFs  
  - ADRs  

- Running the **bullish 4% breakout scan** on the example Friday produced **127 stocks**.
- Running the **bearish 4% breakdown scan** on the same day produced **148 stocks**.

The scans in TC2000 are built directly from the three conditions for each side (price move, volume vs. yesterday, and minimum volume).

A detailed, step-by-step setup of these scans in TC2000 (for both bullish and bearish sides) is promised in the **next video**, not in this segment.

## 6. Relationship to Actual Buy/Sell Decisions and Next Steps

- The 4% breakout/breakdown scans **do not automatically define buy or sell signals**.
- They only identify **candidates** that are experiencing significant price and volume moves.
- **Additional buy and sell conditions** (entry rules, exit rules, risk management, etc.) are required and will be discussed separately.

Next step (as stated by Pradeep):

- In the **next video**, he will show:
  - How to **set up the 4% breakout and breakdown scans step by step in TC2000** for both bullish and bearish sides.
  - After that, he will cover **specific buy and sell conditions** to use with these scan results.
