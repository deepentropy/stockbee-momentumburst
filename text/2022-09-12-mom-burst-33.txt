 Many times setups in tool inch happen when the market has put in a bottom or you will see that that sector has put in a bottom and then immediately it starts turning. So you may not capture the first leg of the move but the second leg of the move can happen very quickly and that can be a very good tool inch setup. So in order to show that like an example of that I'm going to show you an example of this which is like a good example of how setups near low also work very well. So here in this case it's a very good setup. Why? Because the stock is going down and it's like and it turned and then immediately there was a buying and you'll see these kind of setups. A lot of them happen during the same time on many of the biotechnology stocks because they put in a bottom the market was also having the similar kind of a pattern and then see very orderly now you see that is the kind of tool inch setup you want to find and you see in the first leg of the move it's like a good setup. So you can see that the first leg a lot of buying is hardly selling. It means your tool inch definition first leg is very linear right orderly consolidation near narrow or negative day prior to the consolidation breakout breakout day closing near the high and the stocks makes a move right. So if you see every time you see a setup like this when you're running four percent breakout scan that's when you should get excited and especially the setups which are the first leg kind of setups. So you can see that the market has really put in a bottom kind of a thing or stock has put in a bottom and the first one which forms is the highest probability setup because this can really keep on going up because there's a lot of strong buying here small consolidation the buyers are still there they didn't really sell and the stock can take off. The later in the move you try breakouts the later and later in the move you do a breakouts you're going to find higher and higher failure rate of those breakouts.
