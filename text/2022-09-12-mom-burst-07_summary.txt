## 1. Introduction: Fundamentals vs. Momentum Burst

This lesson addresses a common question in trading momentum bursts:

> Do stocks need good fundamentals (earnings, sales, P/E, price-to-sales, etc.) to work as momentum burst trades?

Pradeep Bond’s answer is clear: **No.** For momentum burst trading, strong fundamentals are **not** a requirement.

## 2. Core Principle: Fundamentals Are Not Required

- **Momentum burst trades** are short-term moves, typically lasting **3 to 5 days**.  
- These trades focus on **price movement**, not on the underlying business quality.  
- Many traders and market commentators insist on:
  - “True market leaders”
  - Strong earnings and sales
  - Attractive valuation metrics (P/E, price-to-sales, etc.)

Pradeep emphasizes that for **momentum burst trading**, this mindset is **misguided**:

- You **do not need** good fundamentals for a stock to make a strong momentum burst.  
- In fact, **some of the most profitable momentum burst trades** often come from stocks with **extremely poor fundamentals**.

## 3. Evidence from Recent Market Examples

Pradeep uses Telechart to illustrate real market examples of stocks that made large short-term moves without strong fundamentals.

### 3.1 Biotechnology and No-Earnings Stocks

- Many **biotechnology stocks**:
  - Have **no earnings**.
  - Often have **no sales**.
- Despite this, they have produced **100% moves in short swings**.
- These stocks frequently appear among the **biggest movers** over a recent 15-day period, even though they lack any strong fundamental justification.

### 3.2 AXSM and Similar Cases

- Example: **AXSM**  
  - Not a stock with good current earnings or sales.  
  - It may have **potential** for good earnings or sales in the future, but **currently does not**.  
  - Despite that, it made a **big momentum move**.

- Other similar stocks:
  - Have **no sales** and **no earnings**.
  - Are not the kind of stocks fundamental investors would typically care about.
  - Yet they made **large percentage moves** in a short time.

### 3.3 Comparison with “Good Fundamentals” Stocks

- Pradeep maintains a list of stocks with **very good earnings and sales**.  
- During the same period:
  - These fundamentally strong stocks were **not necessarily** the ones making the **biggest moves**.  
  - In contrast, stocks with **poor or no fundamentals** often made **better, larger moves**.

- Key observation:
  - Stocks with **no good fundamental reason** to go up sometimes make **bigger moves** than stocks widely considered to have **good fundamentals**, which may **not move much at all**.

## 4. Practical Trading Implication

For a trader whose **objective is to make money** from **momentum bursts**:

- Treat momentum burst trading as what it is:
  - A **short-term (3–5 day)** price phenomenon.
- **Do not worry about fundamentals** when selecting stocks for momentum burst trades.
- Accept that:
  - **Stocks with poor fundamentals** can often make you **more money** in momentum bursts than stocks with strong fundamentals.
  - The **market’s short-term behavior** does not require a solid fundamental story.

## 5. Key Takeaway for Momentum Burst Traders

- **Momentum burst success is driven by price action, not fundamentals.**  
- You should:
  - Focus on **stocks that are moving**, regardless of earnings, sales, P/E, or other fundamental metrics.
  - Ignore the common advice that you must only trade “true market leaders” with strong fundamentals for this specific strategy.
- If your goal is to **profit from 3–5 day momentum bursts**, then:
  - **Stop filtering out stocks with poor fundamentals.**
  - **Embrace** the fact that many of your best trades may come from stocks with **no earnings, no sales, and no traditional fundamental appeal.**
