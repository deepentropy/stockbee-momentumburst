 There are many variations of two-linch setup. Sometimes the consolidation is just three days, sometimes it can be longer and still they meet your two-linch criteria. So knowing variations of two-linch is important. So here is an example of another two-linch setup which I am going to show you which has a slightly different flavor than what you looked at till now. So in this particular example of ENTA, what you see is there is a first leg. Again, these are all young setups, right? And it has a longer consolidation. But you will see again, it's not up two days in a row, right, on the day of breakout. Consolidation, even though there are a little bit of negative days, but nowhere is 4% breakdowns there. It just goes sideways for a longer period of time. And then there is a breakout and it's a clean breakout. Stock closes near high. Stock has like an A. No problem in terms of any like giving up the gains and that's a clean kind of a breakout. So sometimes the consolidation is going to be just three days. I like at least three days of consolidation. Less than three days is not. Sometimes the consolidation will be longer. This is an example of a longer consolidation. But still, the first leg, if you look at it, there's a lot of aggressive buying in the first leg. Then it went sideways and then it breaking out. Does it meet two-linch criteria? Yes, it still meets two-linch criteria.
