## 1. Introduction: The Single Most Important Parameter

Pradeep emphasizes that if you focus on one single parameter when trading breakouts, you can consistently find breakouts that work better and make larger percentage moves.  
That parameter is **market capitalization**.

## 2. Market Capitalization and Breakout Potential

### 2.1. Why Capitalization Matters

- The **size of a company’s market capitalization** strongly influences how big its price moves can be in percentage terms.  
- **Lower capitalization stocks** tend to make **bigger percentage moves** (e.g., 8%, 10%, 20%, 40% moves) compared to very large-cap stocks.  
- Understanding this relationship helps you prioritize which breakout candidates are likely to deliver the most profit.

### 2.2. The 10 Billion Threshold

- Pradeep repeatedly highlights **$10 billion market capitalization** as a key dividing line.  
- **Stocks with capitalization below $10 billion**:
  - Are more likely to make **large percentage moves**.
  - Dominate the list of stocks that move **20% or more** during strong market periods.
- In a specific observation:
  - Out of **430 stocks** that went up **20%+** during a strong market phase,
  - Only **75 stocks** had capitalization **above $10 billion**.
  - The **bulk of the big movers** had capitalization **below $10 billion**.
- Conclusion: **“Below $10 billion capitalization”** is a critical filter for finding explosive breakouts.

### 2.3. Sub-1 Billion Capitalization and Explosive Moves

- Within the under-$10B group, many of the **most explosive movers** have **capitalization below $1 billion**.  
- The **lower the capitalization**, the more **explosive** the potential move tends to be.  
- This does not mean every low-cap stock will move, but **when they do break out**, the **percentage move** is often much larger than in big caps.

## 3. Using Capitalization with the 4% Breakout Scan

### 3.1. Applying a Capitalization Filter to Scan Results

- Pradeep refers to using a **4% scan** (a scan that finds stocks moving 4% or more).  
- After running the 4% scan, you will typically get **multiple candidates** that look like good setups.  
- To improve your results:
  - **Look at the market capitalization** of each candidate.
  - **Prioritize stocks with capitalization below $10 billion**.
- Example mentioned:
  - A stock like **BSC** with a capitalization of **$2.4 billion** is the type of candidate that fits the criteria for potentially larger percentage moves.

### 3.2. Example: Distribution of Big Movers by Capitalization

- During a recent strong market period (e.g., last 1.5 months or about 15 days of strong action):
  - Many stocks went up **20% or more**.
  - When sorted by capitalization:
    - Only **75 out of 430** big movers had capitalization **above $10 billion**.
    - The **majority** had capitalization **below $10 billion**.
- This empirical observation reinforces the rule:
  - **Most big percentage movers are under $10 billion in market cap.**

## 4. Comparing High vs. Low Capitalization Stocks

### 4.1. Large-Cap Stocks and Limited Percentage Moves

- **Very high capitalization stocks** (large caps and mega caps) tend to:
  - Make **smaller percentage moves**.
  - Have **fewer 4% breakout days**.
  - Even when they break out, the **follow-through** is often limited in percentage terms compared to smaller caps.
- If you consistently choose very high-cap stocks for breakouts, your **profit potential per trade** is generally lower.

### 4.2. Example: Lockheed Martin (LMT)

- **Lockheed Martin (LMT)** is used as a concrete example:
  - Capitalization: around **$112 billion**.
  - Characteristics:
    - It may **not have many 4% breakout days** for long stretches (many months).
    - When it does break out, the **percentage move** is usually **not as big** as that of a stock with capitalization **below $10 billion**.
- This illustrates why focusing on **very large caps** is suboptimal if your goal is **large percentage gains** from breakouts.

## 5. Practical Trade Selection Guidelines

### 5.1. Choosing Between Multiple Good Setups

When you have **5–7 good breakout setups** from your scan:

1. **Check the market capitalization** of each candidate.
2. **Select the ones with lower capitalization**, especially:
   - **Below $10 billion** as a primary filter.
   - Prefer even **smaller caps** (often below $1 billion) if the setups are otherwise comparable.
3. By doing this, you **increase the likelihood** that:
   - Your trades will make **larger percentage moves**.
   - Your **overall profitability** improves.

### 5.2. Special Considerations for Small Accounts

- If you have a **smaller trading account**, this capitalization focus is even more important:
  - You need **bigger percentage moves** to grow the account meaningfully.
  - Focusing on **stocks below $10 billion** in market cap can help you **make more money** relative to your account size.
- The core idea:  
  - **Small accounts benefit most from targeting stocks capable of large percentage moves**, which are typically **lower-cap stocks**.

## 6. Key Takeaways and Core Rules

- **Primary parameter to focus on for breakout trading**:  
  - **Market capitalization**.
- **Core rules from the lesson**:
  1. **Prefer stocks with capitalization below $10 billion** for breakout trades.
  2. Understand that **the lower the capitalization**, the more **explosive** the potential move.
  3. After running a **4% breakout scan**, **filter and prioritize** by capitalization.
  4. Recognize that **most 20%+ movers** in strong markets are **under $10 billion** in market cap.
  5. Avoid relying heavily on **very large-cap stocks** (e.g., $100B+ like Lockheed Martin) if your goal is **large percentage gains**.
  6. If you have a **small account**, focusing on **sub-$10B capitalization stocks** can significantly improve your **profit potential**.

These principles form a simple but powerful framework:  
**Use market capitalization—especially the “below $10 billion” rule—as a primary filter to find breakout stocks with the highest potential for large percentage moves.**
