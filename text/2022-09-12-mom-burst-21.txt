 So in order to understand this particular setup well and trade it well, you need to go through lot more examples of tool links so that in real time when you are running a scan, you can instantly recognize this particular setup very easily. And in order to do that, you need to study as many examples as possible of things which have happened in the past. What I am going to show you is a couple of setups or like in this particular video, I am going to show you one setup example which will show you what to look for in a good tool link setup. For that, let me go to my TC2000 and show it to you. If you go and look at this, on this particular day, you had the first set of tools. So the stock is not up two days in a row, right? It has a narrow or negative day. That's the narrow or negative day prior to breakout. Stock is closing near high. It has linearity. It has persistent buying in the first leg of the move. So it meets all your tool link condition. There is no 4% breakdown. It doesn't have anything. And that is the kind of a setup. If you really focus on these kind of setups only, then what you will see is that. Those kind of setups work very well. If you select a very choppy setup, setup up three days in a row, it's not going to work. So this is the kind of tool link setup on the breakout day. Ideally, you want to see. If you can find setups like this only in a year, then you are going to have much greater probability of success. Everything which you look for in tool link, not up two days in a row, right? Linearity. Linearity is here. Even the consolidation is very orderly, right? Narrow or negative day prior to the breakout. Narrow or negative day prior to the breakout. Consolidation quality, very orderly, compact consolidation, just up four days. No big volume during the consolidation. There is no 4% breakdown during the consolidation. Stock is breaking out, closing near the high. So it meets every single condition in tool link.
