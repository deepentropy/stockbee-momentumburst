## 1. Introduction

This lesson explains how to set up a **4% breakout and breakdown chart template** in TC2000.  
The goal is to:

- Visually mark days when a stock moves **+4% or more** (breakout) or **−4% or more** (breakdown) on higher volume.  
- Add a **Trend Intensity (TI 65)** indicator to understand whether the stock is in a bullish or bearish trend.  
- Create a reusable chart template that can be applied to any stock to quickly see 4% moves and trend context.

## 2. Setting Up the Base Chart in TC2000

### 2.1 Open a New Blank Chart

1. In TC2000, start with a **new chart**:
   - Either click the **new chart symbol** on the layout, or  
   - Go to **Chart → Blank Chart**.
2. This opens a default price chart based on your current settings.

### 2.2 Adjust Chart Properties (Candles, Grid, Watermark, Scaling)

1. **Edit Chart Properties**:
   - Set chart type to **Candlestick**.
   - Change candle color:
     - Set candles to **black** instead of green (for a cleaner look).

2. **Grid Lines**:
   - If you don’t want horizontal/vertical grid lines, set their value to **0** to remove them and get a clean chart.

3. **Watermark**:
   - Adjust watermark visibility (symbol name in the background) using the watermark settings:
     - You can make it lighter or bolder depending on preference.

4. **Right-Side Gap (Price Padding)**:
   - There is often an unnecessary gap between the last price bar and the right edge of the chart.
   - Use the **small triangle** on the right edge of the chart to drag the price bars closer to the edge and remove that gap.

5. **Vertical Scaling**:
   - If the chart looks too “tall” or compressed, adjust the vertical scale:
     - Use the **triangle** on the price scale to bring the scale down to around **40–50%** for a more natural look.

At this point, you have a clean price-only chart ready for indicators.

## 3. Adding and Formatting Volume

1. **Add Volume Plot**:
   - Right-click (or left-click depending on your setup) on the chart and choose **Edit → Add Plot**.
   - Search for **Volume** and add it.

2. **Remove Volume Moving Average (Optional)**:
   - By default, TC2000 adds a **50-period moving average** on volume.
   - If you don’t need it, remove it from the volume plot.

3. **Volume Colors**:
   - By default, volume bars may be green/red.
   - Change them to:
     - **Black** and **red** (as used in the lesson) for consistency and clarity.

4. **Resize Volume Panel**:
   - Drag the panel boundary to make the volume window smaller so price remains the main focus.

---

## 4. Creating the 4% Breakout (Bullish) Indicator

### 4.1 Add a Custom PCF True Indicator

1. On the chart, **Add Plot → Custom PCF % True Indicator**.
2. This type of indicator is used because the 4% breakout condition is **true/false** (yes/no).

By default, TC2000 inserts a formula like `C / C1`, which you will replace.

### 4.2 Visual Formatting (Area, Color, Fill)

1. Edit the newly added indicator:
   - Change **Plot Type** from **Line** to **Area**.
   - Set **Color** to **green** (for bullish).
   - Set **Area Fill Color** to a **lighter green** for a clear visual highlight.

### 4.3 Bullish 4% Breakout Formula

Replace the default formula with the 4% breakout condition:

- **Formula:**

  ```text
  C / C1 >= 1.04 AND
  V > V1 AND
  V >= 100000
  ```

- Explanation:
  - `C / C1 >= 1.04` → Today’s close is at least **4% higher** than yesterday’s close.
  - `V > V1` → Today’s volume is **greater than** yesterday’s volume.
  - `V >= 100000` → Today’s volume is at least **100,000 shares** (liquidity filter).

2. Label the indicator (optional but recommended):
   - For example, name it **4** (for 4% bullish).

3. After clicking OK, you will see **green spikes/areas** on days where the 4% breakout condition is true.

### 4.4 Visual Interpretation on Different Stocks

- Example: **Beyond Meat (BYND)**  
  - You will see green areas on days where:
    - The stock had a **4% breakout** with higher volume and at least 100k shares.
- Example: **Tesla (TSLA)**  
  - You can visually identify:
    - Days with 4% breakouts that started moves (e.g., a 4% breakout that led to a **14% move**).
- Example: **Apple (AAPL)**  
  - You may notice long periods with **no 4% breakout**, and then a breakout that **did not follow through**, which is also useful information.

This visual representation helps you quickly see where significant bullish momentum days occurred.

## 5. Creating the 4% Breakdown (Bearish) Indicator

### 5.1 Add a Second Custom PCF True Indicator

1. Again, **Add Plot → Custom PCF % True Indicator**.
2. This will be the **bearish** 4% breakdown condition.

### 5.2 Visual Formatting (Area, Color, Fill)

1. Edit the new indicator:
   - Change **Plot Type** to **Area**.
   - Set **Color** to **red**.
   - Set **Area Fill Color** to a **light red/pink**.

### 5.3 Bearish 4% Breakdown Formula

Use the following formula:

- **Formula:**

  ```text
  C / C1 <= 0.96 AND
  V > V1 AND
  V >= 100000
  ```

- Explanation:
  - `C / C1 <= 0.96` → Today’s close is at least **4% lower** than yesterday’s close.
  - `V > V1` → Today’s volume is **greater than** yesterday’s volume.
  - `V >= 100000` → Volume is at least **100,000 shares**.

2. Label this indicator (for example) as **4.96** or any label that reminds you it’s the 4% breakdown.

### 5.4 Overlaying Bullish and Bearish in One Panel

Initially, the bullish and bearish 4% indicators may appear in **separate panels**. To combine them:

1. On the bearish indicator panel, use the **Move → Move and Overlay** option.
2. Overlay it onto the **bullish 4% indicator panel**.

Now:

- **Green areas** = 4% breakouts (bullish).
- **Red/pink areas** = 4% breakdowns (bearish).
- Both are in the **same panel**, making it easy to see all 4% events in one place.

You can adjust the panel height to your preference.

---

## 6. Arranging Panels: Price, 4% Panel, and Volume

To match the layout used in the lesson:

1. You may want the **4% breakout/breakdown panel at the top** and **volume at the bottom**.
2. To do this:
   - Move the **volume panel down**:
     - Click on the volume panel and use **Insert Here** or move it so that volume is at the bottom.
   - Ensure the **4% panel** is just below the price chart.

Final layout:

- Top: **Price chart**  
- Middle: **4% breakout/breakdown panel**  
- Bottom: **Volume (with TI overlaid later)**

## 7. Adding the Trend Intensity (TI 65) Indicator

The Trend Intensity (TI 65) indicator is used to visually identify periods of bullish or bearish trend based on moving averages of price.

You will add it as **two PCF True indicators** (bullish and bearish) and overlay them on the **volume panel**.

### 7.1 Bullish Trend Intensity (TI)

1. **Add Plot → Custom PCF % True Indicator**.
2. Edit the indicator:
   - Change **Plot Type** to **Area**.
   - Set **Color** to **green**.
   - Set **Area Fill Color** to a **light green**.

3. Use the following formula:

   ```text
   AVG(C,7) / AVG(C,65) >= 1.05
   ```

   (In TC2000 syntax, this is written as `average C7 / average C65 >= 1.05`.)

   - Interpretation:
     - The **7-day average close** is at least **5% above** the **65-day average close**.
     - This indicates a **bullish trend**.

4. Label this indicator as **TI** (for Trend Intensity).

5. After applying, you will see green areas where the bullish TI condition is true.

6. **Overlay on Volume**:
   - Use **Move → Move and Overlay** to place this TI indicator on the **volume panel**.

### 7.2 Bearish Trend Intensity (TI)

1. Again, **Add Plot → Custom PCF % True Indicator**.
2. Edit the indicator:
   - Change **Plot Type** to **Area**.
   - Set **Color** to **red**.
   - Set **Area Fill Color** to a **light red**.

3. Use the following formula:

   ```text
   AVG(C,7) / AVG(C,65) <= 0.95
   ```

   (In TC2000 syntax: `average C7 / average C65 <= 0.95`.)

   - Interpretation:
     - The **7-day average close** is at least **5% below** the **65-day average close**.
     - This indicates a **bearish trend**.

4. Label this indicator also as **TI** so you know both are part of Trend Intensity.

5. Overlay this bearish TI indicator on the **same volume panel**:
   - Use **Move → Move and Overlay**.

Now the volume panel shows:

- Volume bars.
- Green TI areas for bullish trend.
- Red TI areas for bearish trend.

## 8. Saving the Complete 4% Chart Template

Once the chart is fully configured:

1. **Save the Chart**:
   - Use the save option and give the chart a clear name, for example: **4P** (to distinguish it from any existing “4” chart you may already have).

2. **Finding the Saved Chart Later**:
   - If the chart layout disappears or you want to apply it again:
     - Go to **Chart**.
     - Under the list of chart templates (including Blank Chart), you will see your saved template (e.g., **4P**).
     - Select it to reapply the full 4% breakout/breakdown + TI setup.

---

## 9. Practical Use and Visual Advantages

With this setup, you now have a **complete 4% breakout/breakdown chart** with **Trend Intensity**:

- **4% Panel**:
  - Shows all **4% breakouts** (green) and **4% breakdowns** (red) with volume confirmation and minimum liquidity.
  - Helps you quickly see where significant moves started, and whether they led to larger trends (e.g., a 4% breakout that led to a 14% move in Tesla).

- **TI 65 on Volume**:
  - Shows **bullish trend periods** (green TI) and **bearish trend periods** (red TI).
  - Gives context to 4% moves: you can see whether a breakout is happening in an already strong trend or against a weak trend.

- **Examples**:
  - **Tesla**: Multiple 4% breakouts, some starting strong moves.
  - **Apple**: Long periods without 4% breakouts, and a breakout that did not follow through.
  - **Beyond Meat**: Clear 4% breakout days marked.

Once this template is saved and applied, you are ready to use it as a visual tool to identify and trade 4% breakouts and breakdowns, with trend context provided by TI 65.
