 When it comes to tool-inch kind of setups in 4% breakout, the nuances matter. And the more you pay attention to nuances, the better you will become into this setup. Now here is an example of the kind of nuances which you always need to keep in mind for looking at a good setup. Now, if this is a good setup, here you have this first leg of the move, right? And then it sets up very orderly consolidation or a pullback and then it is breaking out, right? Now this same stock, here, this is young, right? Means like here it has just had like in a first or second leg and then it is breaking out. Later in the move, here, this is a well known stock by the end, everybody's eyes are on it, right? And it has a breakout. Now first leg, second leg, third leg, this is a fourth leg, so is it young? No. The, the, typically the older the setup becomes, more is the rate of failures. Younger the setup, more is the probability that you are going to make money in this setup. So always remember, look for younger setup. Anything which looks so obvious after it has made such a big move, the breakouts many times attracts profit taking. So if you buy very fourth, fifth, sixth leg of the move, you are going to find again and again that your rate of win will decrease. So try and find setups. Which are like in a, ideal setups are the one which is like in a, after the first leg is established, the first setup is shows up in two links. And then later we are going to see how you can find even the first leg of the move itself by another kind of a setup using four percent breakout. But younger the setup, better it is, is what you have to remember. The more the stock has lot of people's eyes and everybody is excited about consolidation and it's a fourth, fifth kind of a leg of the move, more likely. It is going to fail.
