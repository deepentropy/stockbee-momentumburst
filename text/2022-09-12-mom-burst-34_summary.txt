## 1. Introduction: From Stock Selection to Entry Timing

Once you have done a good job of selecting the right kind of stock using tools like the 4% breakout or dollar breakout, the next critical question is: **When should you enter the trade?**  
This lesson focuses on the **timing of entry** for breakout trades and how it affects risk, reward, and overall performance.

## 2. Core Principle: Enter Breakouts as Early as Possible

### 2.1. Why Early Entry Improves Risk–Reward

- As soon as you identify a **good breakout**, you should aim to **enter as early as possible**.  
- Early entry allows you to:
  - Place **tighter stops** (closer to the breakout level).
  - Capture more of the **momentum move** as it develops.
- Many of the best breakouts:
  - Occur **first thing in the morning**.
  - Often **continue to move up throughout the day** if they are genuine, strong breakouts.

The earlier you can identify and enter a valid breakout, the **better your risk–reward** profile for this breakout-based methodology.

### 2.2. Impact of Late Entry on Stop Size

- The **further away** from the initial breakout point you enter, the **wider your stop** must be.
- If you enter a breakout **late in the day** (e.g., in the last hour), your stop will naturally be **much wider**, because:
  - The stock has already moved significantly from the breakout level.
  - Protecting the trade requires a larger distance between your entry and your stop.

Thus, **late entries increase risk** (via wider stops) without necessarily improving your reward.

---

## 3. Market Conditions and Breakout Failure

- Entering early does not guarantee success; **some breakouts will fade**.
- Breakouts are more likely to **fail or fade** when:
  - The **overall market is weak**.
  - The market is in a **downtrend**.
  - The market is **not really going up** (lack of broad momentum).

The tactic remains: **enter early**, but be aware that **market context** influences whether the breakout follows through or fades.

---

## 4. Acceptable Times to Enter Breakouts During the Day

While early entry is preferred, breakouts can still be entered at various times during the regular trading session:

- You **can** buy a breakout at:
  - 11:00 a.m.
  - 1:00 p.m.
  - 2:00 p.m.
  - 3:00 p.m.
  - 4:00 p.m. (end of regular session)

These entries **can work**, but the **ideal** is still to enter **as soon as the breakout becomes apparent**, especially in the morning when many strong moves begin.

---

## 5. Times and Situations to Avoid Entering Breakouts

### 5.1. Avoid After-Market Breakout Entries

- You **should not** be buying breakouts in the **after-market** (after-hours trading).
- After-market entries are outside the intended structure of this breakout method and do not align with the intraday momentum behavior being exploited.

### 5.2. Avoid Entering Breakouts the Next Day

- You **should not** be buying a breakout **the next day** after it occurs.
- Reasons:
  - These breakout moves typically last **3 to 5 days**.
  - If you **miss the early entry**, your **profit opportunity shrinks** significantly.
  - On the next day:
    - There is **no guarantee** of a good entry.
    - If the breakout was **very powerful**, there may be a **scramble to get in**, causing the stock to **gap up**.
    - A gap up means you are **unlikely to get a favorable entry price**.

For methods like the **4% breakout** or **dollar breakout**, the **most ideal entry** is **as soon as the breakout is clearly visible on the day it occurs**, not the next day.

---

## 6. Breakout Duration and Follow-Through

- Typical breakout moves last about **3 to 5 days**.
- Entering early:
  - Increases your **win rate**.
  - Improves the **follow-through** you can capture.
- If you delay entry, you may:
  - Enter when much of the move has already occurred.
  - Have a **larger stop** and **less upside** remaining.

---

## 7. Practical Example: 4% Morning Breakout Turning into a Large Move

Example scenario:

- A stock triggers a **4% breakout** in the **first 15–20 minutes** of the trading day.
- You buy the breakout at around **4–5% above** the prior level.
- If it is a **genuine, strong breakout**:
  - By the **end of the day**, the stock might be up **10%, 12%, 14%, 15%, 16%, or even 20%**.
- If you had **waited** until the end of the day to enter:
  - Your **entry** would be much higher.
  - Your **stop** would need to be **10–14% (or more)** away from your entry to give the trade room.
  - This significantly **worsens your risk–reward**.

This illustrates why **buying breakouts early** is a **significant advantage** in breakout trading.

## 8. Key Takeaways and Trading Tactics Summary

- **Select good stocks** using tools like the **4% breakout** or **dollar breakout**.
- **Enter as soon as the breakout is apparent**, ideally:
  - Early in the day.
  - Especially in the **first 15–20 minutes** when many strong breakouts appear.
- **Early entry = tighter stops + better risk–reward + more follow-through**.
- **Late entry = wider stops + reduced profit potential**.
- Breakouts can be entered during regular hours (11:00, 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00), but **earlier is better**.
- **Do not**:
  - Buy breakouts in the **after-market**.
  - Buy breakouts **the next day**, due to:
    - 3–5 day move structure.
    - Risk of **gaps** and poor entries.
- Be aware that **breakouts can fade**, especially in **weak or downtrending markets**, but the core tactic remains: **find and enter valid breakouts as early as possible**.
