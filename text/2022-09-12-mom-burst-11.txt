 If you are not trading a US market and then if your question is will this momentum burst work in my market? The answer is in most market momentum burst works. We have members from different countries who have told me in multiple times they have told me that they have taken momentum burst as a method and starting using it in their country and it has worked. So momentum works everywhere. Momentum burst works everywhere. There are some countries where you might have trouble making momentum burst work and that has nothing to do with momentum burst not working but that has to do with the way the rules are. In certain countries there are price filters. That means if a stock is up 5% for a day they stop trading that particular stock. So in that kind of a country you are going to have a problem trading momentum burst. But out of all the members who speak to me I have come across that problem only in one or two countries. So the answer is out of 130 countries where there is a stock market if you look at a chart of any stock in that country and if you study momentum burst is how stocks will be moving in that country also. So whether you are in Great Britain or in Europe or in Korea or in China or in Singapore or in Malaysia or whichever country. Where there is a stock market momentum burst is going to work the same way in your stock market. Do you need to make some changes? Maybe because I don't know all the markets but I know from members definitely that there are members who are making money using momentum burst in their local markets. Momentum burst will work in your country as long as you understand the concept and adopt the volume filters or the price perception. Change filters to your country.
