## 1. Overview of Sector Selection for 4% Breakouts

When using a 4% breakout strategy, sector selection is critical. Certain sectors repeatedly produce larger and more explosive moves year after year. By focusing 4% breakout trades in these sectors, traders increase the probability of strong follow-through and larger gains in a short time frame (typically 3–5 days).

The lesson emphasizes that while occasionally a stock outside these sectors will make a big move, most of the largest and fastest moves tend to come from a specific set of sectors.

## 2. The Three High-Potential Sectors

### 2.1 Healthcare (Biotechnology Focus)

- Within healthcare, biotechnology stocks are highlighted as the primary source of explosive moves.
- In most bullish markets, the largest movers are often biotechnology names.
- Biotech stocks have a strong tendency to:
  - Produce powerful 4% breakouts.
  - Deliver large percentage gains quickly.
- For 4% breakout traders, biotech is described as the most important sub-sector to watch within healthcare.

### 2.2 Technology

- Technology is identified as the second key sector for 4% breakouts.
- Tech stocks typically:
  - Have a higher probability of follow-through after a breakout.
  - Make larger moves in percentage terms compared to many other sectors.
- This pattern has held true for many years, even though the definition of “technology” evolves over time.
- Any stock tied to new or emerging technologies tends to be a strong candidate for big moves.

### 2.3 Consumer Discretionary

- Consumer discretionary includes goods and services that are not necessities, such as:
  - Luxury goods
  - Fashion items (e.g., shoes, branded apparel like Lululemon pants)
  - Perfumes and similar lifestyle products
- These stocks inherently tend to:
  - Make more explosive moves.
  - Respond strongly to demand shifts, trends, and market sentiment.
- As a group, they are more likely to produce the kind of 10–20% moves in a few days that 4% breakout traders seek.

## 3. Sectors to Avoid for 4% Breakouts

Some sectors generally do not produce the kind of fast, large moves that 4% breakout traders are targeting:

- Utilities  
- Defense stocks  
- Stable consumer staples such as:
  - Procter & Gamble
  - Colgate

These types of stocks tend to move more slowly and lack the explosive breakout behavior seen in healthcare (especially biotech), technology, and consumer discretionary.

## 4. Impact of Sector Choice on Trade Outcomes

Focusing on the three highlighted sectors has a direct impact on the quality of 4% breakout trades:

- By selecting breakouts from healthcare (especially biotech), technology, and consumer discretionary, traders:
  - Expose their capital to stocks with a built-in tendency to make large moves.
  - Increase the likelihood of capturing 10–15–20% gains within 3–5 days.
- In contrast, choosing slower-moving sectors (like utilities or defensive consumer staples) reduces the probability of such rapid, high-percentage moves.

The core idea: sector selection is a key edge. The same 4% breakout pattern is more powerful when applied to inherently fast-moving sectors.

## 5. Internal Mnemonic: “Plastics”

To internalize this focus, the lesson refers to an internal shorthand: “focus on plastics.”

In this context, “plastics” is used as a mnemonic or internal phrase to remind traders to concentrate on:

- Healthcare (with emphasis on biotechnology)  
- Technology  
- Consumer discretionary  

The repeated instruction is to always select 4% breakout candidates primarily from these three sectors to maximize the potential for explosive short-term moves.
