## 1. Introduction: Purpose of Using Filters on 4% Breakouts

Using filters on 4% breakouts helps reduce the number of stocks you need to evaluate, so you are not overwhelmed by a large list of candidates (e.g., 300 breakouts). This is especially useful for beginning traders who can easily become confused when faced with too many choices.

The core idea:  
- Start with all 4% breakouts.  
- Apply additional filters to narrow the list to a manageable number of high-quality candidates.

## 2. The Top 25 Breakouts Filter

### 2.1. Concept and Rationale

One effective filter Pradeep used for 2–3 years is the “Top 25 Breakouts” filter:

- From all 4% breakouts, only consider the top 25 stocks ranked by a momentum measure called TI65.
- This focuses your attention on stocks showing **extremely strong buying** and **high momentum**.
- The goal is to find good buy candidates within this smaller, high-momentum subset instead of scanning every breakout.

This method is particularly helpful for beginners who want to reduce the number of charts they must analyze.

### 2.2. Implementation in TC2000

In TC2000, the process is:

1. Start with your 4% breakout scan (e.g., a list of “stars” or breakout candidates).  
2. Remove any previous filters if necessary (e.g., filters created in earlier steps or videos).  
3. Add a column for TI65 to your watchlist or scan results.  
4. Sort the list by TI65 in descending order (highest momentum at the top).  
5. Only look at the first 25 stocks in this sorted list.

Example from the lesson:
- After removing a prior filter, there were 73 breakout candidates.
- By sorting on TI65 and focusing only on the top 25, the list becomes much more manageable.

### 2.3. Using TI65 as a Momentum Ranking

TI65 is defined as:

> **TI65 = Average(C, 7) / Average(C, 65)**  
> where C is the closing price,  
> Average(C, 7) is the 7-day average close,  
> Average(C, 65) is the 65-day average close.

Interpretation:
- A higher TI65 value indicates that the recent price (7-day average) is significantly higher than the longer-term price (65-day average), signaling strong recent momentum.
- Ranking by TI65 ensures you are focusing on stocks with the strongest current buying pressure.

## 3. Practical Use of the Top 25 Filter

### 3.1. How to Select Trades from the Top 25

Once you have the top 25 breakouts ranked by TI65:

- Review only these 25 charts for potential buy setups.
- Within these 25, you typically will find **one or two good ideas**.
- For example, on a given day (like a Friday in the example), you might end up with just one strong candidate from the top 25.

This keeps your decision-making focused and manageable.

### 3.2. What to Do If No Good Setup Appears

If you go through the top 25 and:

- By the time you reach stock number 25 you **still do not find a good setup**,  
- Then **do not take a trade** from that list.

The rule:  
- You want a stock with **very high momentum and a good technical setup**.  
- If none of the top 25 meet your criteria, you simply skip trading that day from this method.

### 3.3. Trade-Offs and Limitations of Filters

Pradeep notes some important trade-offs:

- Using strict filters like the top 25 TI65 can cause you to **miss some trades** that might have worked but did not rank in the top 25.
- He personally does **not overuse** such filters now because:
  - He has deep experience (22 years using this method).
  - He does not feel overwhelmed by large lists of breakouts.

However, for beginners:
- The benefit of reduced confusion and workload often outweighs the cost of missing some opportunities.

## 4. Psychological and Process Benefits

### 4.1. Reducing Overwhelm for Beginners

Beginners can easily be overwhelmed by:

- Large breakout lists (e.g., 300 or even 70+ names).
- The difficulty of deciding which of many breakouts to buy.

By limiting attention to the top 25:

- You only need to analyze a small, focused list.
- You avoid the stress of trying to choose among too many options.
- You are more likely to execute consistently and confidently.

### 4.2. Lowering Complexity and Confusion

Filters like the top 25 TI65:

- Lower the **complexity** of your daily routine.
- Reduce **confusion** about which stocks to prioritize.
- Help you concentrate on the **strongest momentum names**, which often have better odds of follow-through.

The practical outcome:
- Instead of being stuck between 10+ possible breakouts, you narrow down to 1–2 clear ideas.

### 4.3. Guideline for Adding Filters

General advice on filters:

- Add filters that:
  - **Increase your win rate**, or  
  - **Decrease your confusion**.
- Avoid adding filters just for complexity’s sake.
- For newer traders, simplicity and clarity are more important than capturing every possible trade.

In summary, the top 25 TI65 filter on 4% breakouts is a structured way to:
- Focus on the strongest momentum stocks,
- Reduce the number of charts you must review,
- Lower psychological stress,
- And build a more disciplined, manageable trading process.
