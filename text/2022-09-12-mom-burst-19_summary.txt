## 1. Overview of the 4% Breakout Method

The lesson focuses on trading **4% breakouts on the bullish side**.  
After running a 4% breakout scan, you will typically get **100–200 candidate stocks**. The key is **not** to buy randomly, but to apply a **quality control checklist** so that the setups you choose have a **high probability of moving up for the next 3–4 days**.

The checklist used for this purpose is called **2-LYNCH**.

---

## 2. The Purpose of the 2-LYNCH Checklist

**2-LYNCH** is a structured set of conditions used to filter 4% breakout candidates:

- **2** – Stock should **not be up two days in a row** before the breakout  
- **L** – **Linearity** in prior price moves  
- **Y** – **Young** setup (early leg of the move, and generally younger stocks)  
- **N** – **Negative or narrow-range day** before the breakout  
- **C** – **Consolidation quality** before the breakout  
- **H** – **Close near high** on the breakout day (at the time you buy)

If you apply 2-LYNCH to your breakout list, you will typically narrow down from hundreds of names to **2–4 high-quality ideas** with a much higher probability of follow-through.

## 3. Component 1: “2” – Not Up Two Days in a Row

**Rule:**  
Before the 4% breakout day, the stock **should not be up two days in a row**.

- If a stock has already been up for **two consecutive days**, the **swing has already started**.  
- You want to **enter at the start of a swing**, not after it is already underway.

**Tolerance:**

- Very small up moves (e.g., **+0.1%, +0.2%, up to about +2%**) on prior days are acceptable.  
- A stock that is up **slightly** for one or two days (e.g., +0.5%) may still be taken, but the **ideal candidate** is one that is **not meaningfully up two days in a row**.

**Practical use:**

- If a stock is clearly **up two days in a row** before the breakout, **discard it immediately**.  
- This is a **first filter**: if it fails here, you don’t need to check the other criteria.

---

## 4. Component 2: “L” – Linearity

**Linearity** refers to how **smooth and predictable** a stock’s prior moves have been.

**What you want:**

- A stock with a history of **smooth, persistent, and consistent buying**.  
- Prior moves that are **orderly and directional**, not erratic.

**Why linearity matters:**

- **Choppy stocks**:
  - Require **wider stops**  
  - Are **unpredictable**  
  - Can be **very choppy intraday**, making execution and risk control difficult  
- **Linear stocks**:
  - Show **predictable moves**  
  - Indicate **strong, persistent buying** in prior runs  
  - Increase the **probability that the breakout will work**

**Key point:**

- Linearity is described as **extremely important**—the **most important criterion**.  
- The trader **only selects linear setups** and **avoids choppy setups under any circumstances**.

---

## 5. Component 3: “Y” – Young Setup

**Young setup** means:

- The breakout is in the **first or second leg** of a move, **not** the third, fourth, or later leg.  
- The stock itself is preferably **young** in market terms (e.g., IPO within the last **10 years**).

**Why young setups:**

- **Breakout methods**, including 4% breakouts, **work better on younger stocks** and **early legs** of a move.  
- **Older stocks** tend not to make **explosive moves**.  
- Later legs (3rd, 4th, 5th, etc.) have a **much higher probability of failure**.

**Analogy used in the lesson:**

- Just as older hedge fund managers or Leonardo DiCaprio prefer younger partners, you want **younger setups** and **younger stocks** for explosive moves.

**Practical rule:**

- Focus on:
  - **First or second leg** of a move  
  - Stocks that are **not very old** (IPO within ~10 years is preferred)  
- Avoid:
  - **Third, fourth, fifth, or sixth legs** of a continuous move

## 6. Component 4: “N” – Negative or Narrow-Range Day Before Breakout

The **day before the breakout** is critical.

**Requirement:**

- The day before the 4% breakout should be:
  - A **negative (down) day**, or  
  - A **narrow-range day** (e.g., a **doji** or **small candle**)

**Why this matters:**

- You want to buy the breakout at the **start of a new swing**, not in the middle of an ongoing push.  
- A **negative or narrow-range day** indicates:
  - **Low volatility** before the breakout  
  - A setup where, when the breakout occurs, it can **“explode”** out of that low-volatility state  
- This explosive move can lead to **10–40% gains in 3–5 days**.

**Consequence of ignoring this:**

- If you select stocks **without** a negative or narrow day before the breakout, you are **unlikely to make much money** from the move.

## 7. Component 5: “C” – Consolidation Quality

Before a 4% breakout, the stock typically forms a **consolidation**. The **quality of this consolidation** is **extremely critical**.

You evaluate consolidation quality on three main aspects:

### 7.1 4% Breakdowns During Consolidation

- During the consolidation, the stock **should not have more than one 4% breakdown**.  
- If there are **two or three 4% breakdowns** in the consolidation:
  - It indicates **weak or absent strong buyers**.  
  - Such breakouts are **more likely to fail**.

**Ideal:**

- **No 4% breakdowns** during consolidation.  
- Acceptable: **At most one** 4% breakdown.

### 7.2 Tight, Orderly Price Action

- The consolidation should be **tight**:
  - **Low volatility**  
  - **Orderly** price action  
  - No wild **up-and-down swings**  
  - No “jumping all over the place”

**Why:**

- A tight, orderly consolidation suggests **controlled trading** and **accumulation**, not random noise.  
- This sets up a **clean breakout** with better follow-through.

### 7.3 Low Volume in Consolidation

- During consolidation, **volume should be low** and ideally **keep dropping**.

**Interpretation:**

- **Low and declining volume**:
  - Indicates **few sellers**  
  - Suggests that whatever selling is happening is being **absorbed**  
- **High volume up-and-down days** in consolidation:
  - Indicate **no settled or strong buyers**  
  - Suggest instability and a higher chance of **failed breakouts**

**Summary of consolidation quality:**

- **No more than one 4% breakdown**  
- **Tight, orderly price action**  
- **Low and declining volume**, without high-volume choppy days

## 8. Component 6: “H” – Close Near High

The final filter is how the stock **closes relative to its high** on the breakout day.

**Rule:**

- The stock should be **closing near the high** when you select it to buy.

**Why this matters:**

- If a stock:
  - Breaks out strongly intraday  
  - Then **gives back a large portion** of its gains and you buy it after that  
- It indicates **weak momentum**:
  - If it **cannot maintain momentum on the first breakout day**, it is unlikely to show strong momentum on the **second or third day**.

**What to avoid:**

- Stocks with **big upper tails** on the breakout candle  
- Stocks that have **given up half or more** of the day’s gain  
- Stocks that have **given up 60%** of the day’s gain

**Acceptable giveback:**

- The instructor is willing to accept up to about **30% giveback** of the day’s gain.  
  - Example:  
    - Stock is up **$10** intraday  
    - It gives back **$3** and is still up **$7**  
    - This is still acceptable.  
- You can be **stricter** if you want:
  - Only take stocks that give back **10–20%** of the move.

**Key idea:**

- A stock that **closes strong and near its high** signals that **buyers are still active at that price**.  
- This is a **qualitative confirmation** of the breakout’s strength.

### 8.1 Intraday Application of “Close Near High”

You **do not** have to wait until the **end of the day** to apply the “close near high” rule.

- At any time (e.g., **9:45 or 10:00 AM**), when you run your **4% breakout scan** and apply **2-LYNCH**:
  - Treat the current price as the **“close” of that minute**.  
  - At that moment, the stock should be **trading near its intraday high**.

**Clarification:**

- Every minute of the market has a **current price**, which you can treat as a **temporary close**.  
- The requirement is: **at the time you are buying**, the stock should be **near its high** for that point in the session.

## 9. Putting 2-LYNCH Together for 4% Breakouts

To trade **momentum burst** setups using the **4% breakout** method, you must understand and apply **2-LYNCH** as a complete checklist:

1. **2 – Not up two days in a row**  
   - The stock should **not** be meaningfully up for **two consecutive days** before the breakout.

2. **L – Linearity**  
   - The stock should have a history of **smooth, persistent, and predictable moves**, not choppy action.

3. **Y – Young setup**  
   - The breakout should be in the **first or second leg** of a move.  
   - Prefer **younger stocks** (e.g., IPO within the last 10 years).  
   - Avoid **third, fourth, fifth, or later legs**.

4. **N – Negative or narrow-range day before breakout**  
   - The day before the breakout should be a **down day** or a **narrow-range/small candle day** (e.g., doji).  
   - This ensures **low volatility** before an **explosive breakout**.

5. **C – Consolidation quality**  
   - **No more than one 4% breakdown** in the consolidation.  
   - Consolidation should be **tight and orderly**, not choppy.  
   - **Low and declining volume** during consolidation; avoid high-volume, choppy action.

6. **H – Close near high**  
   - At the time you buy, the stock should be **closing/trading near its high**.  
   - Avoid stocks that give back **half or more** of their intraday gains.  
   - Prefer those that **hold most of the breakout move** into your entry.

When you apply **all** of these conditions to your 4% breakout scan:

- A large list of **100–200 names** will typically shrink to **2–4 high-quality setups**.  
- These selected setups have a **much higher probability** of delivering **strong, short-term momentum bursts** over the next **3–5 days**.

The instructor emphasizes that **only when all 2-LYNCH conditions are met** should you select a stock for a 4% breakout trade.
