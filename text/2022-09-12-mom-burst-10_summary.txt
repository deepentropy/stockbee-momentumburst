## 1. Understanding Momentum Bursts

### 1.1 Definition and Nature

A momentum burst is a sudden, sharp move in a stock’s price, typically characterized by a rapid and significant range expansion. It often appears as a strong, explosive move where the stock quickly advances, sometimes by large percentages (e.g., 40% in a day).

Key characteristics:
- The move is **sudden** and **explosive**.
- It is driven by **sudden momentum** entering the stock.
- The initial part of the move often happens without clear advance warning.

### 1.2 Sudden Range Expansion and Momentum

Momentum bursts are triggered by a **sudden range expansion**:
- A stock that was trading in a relatively normal or quiet range suddenly experiences a large increase in price movement.
- This range expansion is what starts the momentum burst.
- The burst is a **reactive phenomenon**: you see it clearly only once it has started.

Because the burst is driven by sudden momentum, it is inherently difficult to foresee the exact day or moment when it will occur.

## 2. Limits of Anticipating Momentum Bursts

### 2.1 Why Most Bursts Cannot Be Predicted

Not all momentum bursts can be anticipated. In fact, **most cannot**:
- The **first part** of a momentum burst is particularly hard to anticipate.
- The most **explosive** momentum bursts are the ones you will **never** be able to anticipate reliably.
- According to Pradeep, **about 70–80% of momentum bursts cannot be anticipated**.

Reasons:
- The start of the burst is a **sudden event** with no guaranteed prior signal.
- There is **no way to know** on a given day that a specific stock will break out or have a momentum burst.
- The method of trading momentum bursts is therefore **primarily reactive**, not predictive.

### 2.2 The Illusion of Predictability from Charts

Charts can create an illusion that momentum bursts were obvious in hindsight:
- After a big move, the prior price action may look like a **low-range, quiet setup** before the burst.
- This can tempt traders to believe that the burst was clearly predictable.
- In reality, **on that day**, before the move, there was **no certain way to know** that the stock would break out or have a momentum burst.

Key point:
- Hindsight makes patterns look clearer than they were in real time.
- Traders must recognize this illusion and avoid overestimating their ability to predict bursts.

## 3. When Momentum Bursts Can Be Anticipated

### 3.1 First vs. Second Momentum Burst

Pradeep distinguishes between:
- The **first momentum burst** in a stock’s move.
- A **second momentum burst** that may occur after the first.

Insights:
- The **first momentum burst** is generally **not anticipatable**; it starts suddenly.
- After a stock has already had a **first momentum burst**, there are **some cases** where a **second momentum burst** can be anticipated.
- In such cases, a trader might **enter in anticipation** of a possible second burst, based on the prior behavior of the stock.

However:
- This is only possible in **some** situations.
- It does **not** change the fact that **most** bursts, especially the initial and most explosive ones, cannot be predicted in advance.

### 3.2 Reactive vs. Anticipatory Methods

Pradeep contrasts two approaches:

- **Momentum Burst Trading (Reactive Method)**  
  - You react to the burst **after** it starts.  
  - The method is based on recognizing **sudden momentum and range expansion** as they occur.  
  - It accepts that you will **not catch the very beginning** of most moves.

- **Anticipation Trading (Anticipatory Method)**  
  - You try to enter **before** the move, expecting a breakout or burst.  
  - This can sometimes work for **second bursts** or certain setups.  
  - But it **cannot** reliably capture the majority of momentum bursts.

Core message:
- Momentum burst trading is **inherently reactive**.
- Anticipation can play a role, but it **cannot be the sole basis** for capturing most bursts.

## 4. Practical and Psychological Implications

### 4.1 Realistic Expectations for Traders

Traders must set realistic expectations about what is possible:
- You **cannot** anticipate every momentum burst.
- If your goal is to **anticipate every single burst**, you will miss **70–80%** of them.
- The **most explosive** moves are precisely the ones you will **not** be able to foresee.

Implication:
- Accept that you will **often be late** to the move.
- Focus on having a **robust reactive process** rather than chasing perfect prediction.

### 4.2 Risks of Building a Strategy Only on Anticipation

Building your entire trading approach around anticipating momentum bursts is dangerous:
- You will **miss most opportunities**, because most bursts are not predictable.
- You may become overconfident due to **hindsight bias** from looking at charts after the fact.
- You may waste time and capital trying to guess the exact day a stock will break out, even though there is **no reliable way** to know that in advance.

Key psychological advice:
- Recognize that **momentum burst trading is reactive by nature**.
- Use anticipation **selectively** (e.g., in some second-burst scenarios), but do not rely on it as your primary edge.
- Avoid the illusion that every big move was obvious beforehand; it was not.

This lesson emphasizes that while some momentum bursts—especially follow-on or second bursts—can occasionally be anticipated, the majority, particularly the most explosive ones, are sudden and must be traded with a **reactive mindset**, not an anticipatory one.
