 What kind of a stop to use? Mental stop or a hard stop? I am not a fan of mental stop. I use hard stops. Many people have these lot of opinions about stops. They think that market makers are going to gun for your stops. This is going to happen, that is going to happen. I do not subscribe to any of those conspiracy theories. If any market maker is so poor that he is going to be targeting my 1000 or 2000 or 5000 shares, I think he is going to go out of business very soon. So they have a better job than to try and target your stops. That is my thinking but you are entitled to your way of thinking. Now what happens is that once you put in a hard stop, there is another question which I get all the time. Do your stops are active in the after hours or in pre-market? No, my stops only work when the market hours are there. I do not recommend putting in stops in the after hours or in the pre-market stops. If they get activated in pre-market or after hours, you are going to lose a lot of money because there is very little liquidity. And as a result of that you might get partial fills also. So I have been trading this for 22 years. I have no problem putting in stops and carrying the stops next day and only the stops working during the day. So that is very important. Use hard stops. Hard stops means real stops. They are actually in the system and no mental stops. Mental stops are very easy to then start not taking the losses at the right time or like not moving your stops. I am not a fan of just putting mental stops. I use hard stops and my stops are only active during the trading hours. They are not active in after hours or in pre-market.
