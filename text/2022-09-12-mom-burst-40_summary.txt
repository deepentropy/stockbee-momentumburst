## 1. Introduction: Context of the Setup

The lesson assumes you already know a basic swing trading setup, including:
- How to **find** the setup.
- How to **enter** the trade.
- How to **exit** the trade using a conventional stop.

The focus here is on **how to manage the position** once you have experience with the setup and want to **increase profitability** by using more advanced trade management techniques.

---

## 2. Conventional Trade Management (Beginner Focus)

For beginners, the recommended approach is:
- Use a **simple, conventional method**:
  - Standard position sizing (e.g., 5–10% of account per trade).
  - A **normal stop** (e.g., based on the day’s range or a predefined risk).
- Focus on:
  - Executing the setup consistently.
  - Building a **good win rate**.
  - Gaining experience over **years**, not weeks.

Advanced techniques should **not** be the starting point. First, become consistently profitable with the basic method.

---

## 3. Advanced Position Management Concepts

Once you have **enough experience** and a **good win rate**, you can consider more aggressive ways to manage trades.

### 3.1. Large Position Sizing (40–80% of Account)

If you place a **tight stop** (e.g., half of the day’s range), your risk per share is smaller. This allows you to:
- Put **much more capital** into the trade:
  - Instead of 5–10% of your account, you might allocate **40–50%**, or even **60–80%** of your account on a single swing trade.

This large size creates:
- Higher **profit potential**.
- Higher **concentration risk**, which must be managed carefully.

### 3.2. Increasing Risk per Trade (1% vs. 2%)

Another advanced adjustment is to **increase the percentage of account risked per trade**:
- Conventional risk: **1%** of account per trade.
- Advanced risk: **2%** of account per trade.

In the example referenced:
- At **2% risk**, with a tight stop, you can end up with **almost 100% of your capital** in a single swing trade.
- In such a case, it becomes **very important** to manage the position actively, including taking partial profits to:
  - **Reduce risk**.
  - **Free up capital** for the next breakout.

## 4. The 80–20 Technique (Partial Profit-Taking)

### 4.1. How 80–20 Works

The **80–20 technique** is an advanced method of **partial profit-taking** and **position management**:
- You **enter a large position** (often much larger than your normal swing size).
- As the trade moves in your favor:
  - You **take 80% of the position off** (lock in profits).
  - You **keep 20%** of the position to capture any further move.

This can be done:
- On the **second day**.
- On the **third day**.
- Or at a point where the move has already given a good profit.

This approach is sometimes referred to as:
- **“Pilling a position”** (building and then peeling off).
- Related to **reverse pyramid** concepts (building larger early, then reducing size as the move matures).

### 4.2. When 80–20 Makes Sense

80–20 and similar partial profit techniques make sense **only when**:
- You are using **large position sizes**:
  - Typically **50–60–70–80%** of your account in a single swing trade.
- You are **risking more** (e.g., 2% of account) and thus have a **very concentrated** position.

In that context:
- Taking **80% off**:
  - Reduces risk significantly.
  - Frees capital for **new breakouts**.
  - Still leaves a **20% runner** to benefit from any extended move.

If you are **not** using large size, the benefit of 80–20 is minimal.

### 4.3. Example: Tripling Position on a “W” Pattern

In some advanced scenarios:
- On a pattern like a **“W”** (double-bottom type structure), the trader may:
  - **Triple** the position size compared to what they would normally take on a standard swing.
  - Then, as the trade works:
    - **Take 80% off** on the **second or third day**.
    - Keep the remaining **20%** to see if the move extends further.

This is a **highly aggressive** tactic and is only suitable for traders who:
- Have **mastered** the basic setup.
- Have traded it successfully for **years**.

---

## 5. Requirements and Prerequisites for Using Advanced Techniques

### 5.1. Need for Experience and High Win Rate

Advanced techniques like:
- 80–20 partial profit-taking,
- Large position sizing (60–80% of account),
- Reverse pyramiding,

should only be used by traders who:
- Have **mastered** the basic setup.
- Have traded it successfully for a **couple of years**.
- Have a **good win rate**.

Without a solid foundation:
- These techniques will not increase profitability.
- They will likely **complicate** your trading and **worsen** results.

### 5.2. Problems Beginners Face with Advanced Tactics

If a trader:
- Does **not** have a good win rate, and
- Tries to use advanced techniques,

then:
- The trading process becomes **more complicated**.
- Risk of **large drawdowns** increases due to big position sizes.
- The trader may **not execute** the techniques correctly, leading to:
  - Poor exits.
  - Inconsistent decisions.
  - Overall **suboptimal performance**.

For beginners, these methods are **not recommended**.

## 6. When Partial Profit-Taking Is Not Useful

### 6.1. Small Position Sizes (5–10% of Account)

If you are trading:
- **Small positions**, such as **5–10%** of your account per trade,

then:
- **Partial profit-taking (pilling)** does **not** significantly increase profitability.
- Taking 80% off a small position does not meaningfully change:
  - Risk profile.
  - Capital availability.
  - Overall returns.

In such cases, partial profit-taking:
- Adds complexity without real benefit.

### 6.2. Psychological and Decision-Making Issues

Using partial profit-taking with small size often leads to **psychological problems**:
- Constantly asking:
  - “When should I peel?”
  - “Should I take profits now or later?”
- Common mistakes:
  - **Peeling too early** and missing a big move.
  - **Not peeling at the right time**, giving back profits.

The result:
- You **sub-optimize** the trade.
- Your thinking becomes **confused** and **inconsistent**.
- Your overall trading becomes **less effective**.

Therefore, partial profit-taking is only recommended when:
- You are using **large size**, and
- You have the **experience** to manage it.

## 7. Summary Guidance on Progression and Study

- **Step 1: Master the basics**
  - Use conventional position sizing (e.g., 5–10% of account).
  - Use standard stops and exits.
  - Focus on building a **high win rate** and consistent execution.

- **Step 2: Trade the setup for years**
  - Gain **real experience** with the setup.
  - Understand its behavior across different markets.

- **Step 3: Gradually adopt advanced techniques**
  - Only after mastering the setup, consider:
    - Larger position sizes (40–80% of account).
    - Higher risk per trade (e.g., 2%).
    - Advanced methods like **80–20**, **pilling**, and **reverse pyramiding**.

- **Step 4: Use advanced techniques selectively**
  - Only when:
    - You are putting **large capital** into a trade.
    - You need to **manage risk** and **free capital** for new opportunities.

The advanced techniques discussed (80–20, pilling, reverse pyramid) are intended for a **separate advanced section** and are **not** for beginners. Beginners should focus on the **conventional approach** until they have proven, long-term success with the basic setup.
