## 1. Introduction to the 4% Breakout Setup

The lesson focuses on a specific trading setup: the **4% breakout**.  
The key challenge is not just running a scan to find stocks moving 4% or more, but **selecting the right 4% breakout** from the scan results.

The core objective is to develop the skill to distinguish a **high‑quality 4% breakout setup** from a mediocre or poor one.

## 2. The Concept of “Tool Inch” (Setup Selection Skill)

“Tool inch” in this context refers to the **method and skill** used to select a valid 4% breakout setup once it appears in a scan.

- The **critical skill** is:
  - Becoming good at **identifying a proper 4% breakout setup**.
  - Avoiding setups that **do not meet the criteria**.

This is not about changing the scan; it is about **improving your judgment** in choosing which scan results to trade.

## 3. Characteristics of a Good 4% Breakout Setup

Pradeep illustrates what a **good setup** looks like using a specific example. The structure of that example highlights several important elements.

### 3.1 Prior Buying and Momentum

- The stock shows **a lot of buying coming in** before the consolidation.
- This indicates:
  - Strong **demand**.
  - Existing **upward momentum**.
- This prior strength is a **necessary foundation** for a quality breakout.

### 3.2 Sideways Consolidation

- After the strong buying, the stock goes **sideways**.
- This sideways movement is a **consolidation phase**:
  - Price stops trending strongly and trades in a **narrower range**.
  - The stock is essentially **resting** after a move up.
- A good setup typically has this **order**:
  1. Strong buying.
  2. Sideways consolidation.
  3. Breakout.

### 3.3 The Day Before Breakout

- The day before the breakout is described as:
  - A **negative day** (down day).
  - A **narrow range** day.
  - The stock was up only **about 0.5% or less**, effectively going sideways.
- This shows:
  - **No major selling pressure**, just minor pullback or pause.
  - **Tight price action**, which often precedes a strong move.

### 3.4 The Actual Breakout Day

- On the breakout day:
  - The stock makes a **4% breakout**.
  - There is **only one 4% breakout** in this sequence (not multiple erratic spikes).
- This clean, single 4% breakout coming out of a **sideways consolidation** after prior buying is what defines a **good 4% breakout setup** in this example.

## 4. The Role of Historical Study and Example Collection

To become skilled at identifying these setups, Pradeep emphasizes **systematic study**:

- **Collect examples** of good setups:
  - Save charts of strong 4% breakout setups.
  - Build a **file or library** of these examples.
- **Study the criteria**:
  - Review the conditions that were present before the breakout.
  - Note the **pattern of buying, consolidation, and breakout**.
- **Study many historical examples**:
  - The more examples you see, the better your pattern recognition becomes.
  - Repeated exposure trains your eye to see the difference between **good** and **bad** setups.

This is a deliberate practice process: **collect → organize → review → internalize**.

## 5. Developing Instant Recognition of Quality Setups

With enough practice and exposure to good examples:

- You develop the ability to **instantly recognize** a quality setup when it appears in your scan.
- When a stock shows:
  - Prior strong buying,
  - Sideways consolidation,
  - A proper pre‑breakout day,
  - And a clean 4% breakout,
  
  you can quickly identify it as a **high‑probability setup**.

This instant recognition is the **practical edge**: you can act decisively and avoid hesitation or confusion when scanning.

## 6. Impact of Selecting Only Quality Setups

Once you become good at identifying and selecting only **quality 4% breakout setups**:

- You **filter out** weak or non‑qualifying setups.
- You **only trade** those that match the criteria you have learned from your historical study.
- As a result:
  - The **probability of your trades working increases significantly**.
  - Your overall trading performance improves because you are consistently focusing on **high‑probability opportunities** rather than random 4% movers.

The central message:  
**Skillful selection of 4% breakout setups, built through studying many good historical examples, leads to higher probability trades and better trading outcomes.**
