## 1. Introduction: The Challenge of 4% Breakouts

When trading a 4% breakout strategy, a common problem is the large number of breakout candidates on many days—often 200–300 stocks. This volume can be overwhelming and difficult to manage in real time.

To handle this, Pradeep discusses using an additional filter based on longer-term momentum (6-month momentum) to narrow down the list and focus on stronger stocks, especially if the trader intends to hold positions for a longer period.

## 2. Using a 6-Month Momentum Filter (MDT)

### 2.1. Purpose of the 6-Month Momentum Filter

The 6-month momentum filter is designed to:

- Identify stocks with strong momentum over a 126-day (approximately 6-month) period.  
- Reduce the number of 4% breakout candidates to a smaller, higher-quality subset.  
- Focus on stocks that are not just breaking out today, but have been strong over a longer timeframe.

### 2.2. Implementing MDT in TC2000

In TC2000, Pradeep uses a filter called **MDT**:

- MDT is a momentum indicator.  
- It measures whether a stock has momentum over **126 trading days** (about 6 months).  

You add MDT as a filter in your scan so that only stocks with sufficient 6-month momentum are included in your 4% breakout list.

### 2.3. Example of a Strong Momentum Threshold

Pradeep gives an example of a momentum threshold:

- Look for stocks that have an **average momentum of about 1.18% per day** over **126 days**.  
- This is expressed as something like **1.18% / 1.126** in his description, indicating a strong average daily momentum over the 6-month period.

This type of threshold ensures that only very strong momentum stocks pass the filter.

### 2.4. Effect on the Trading Universe

Applying the MDT filter significantly reduces the number of stocks:

- Example: From **73 stocks**, the filter might reduce the universe to only those that are **very strong** on a 6-month basis.  

The result is a smaller, more focused list of candidates that are both:

- Breaking out (4% breakout), and  
- Strong over the last 6 months.

## 3. When a 6-Month Momentum Filter is Most Useful

### 3.1. Longer-Term Holds

The 6-month momentum filter is particularly useful if:

- You are **looking to hold trades for a longer term**, not just very short-term day trades.  
- You want stocks that have **sustained strength**, not just a one-day spike.

### 3.2. Long-Term Consolidations and Breakouts

This filter is also valuable when:

- You are looking for stocks that have had a **long-term consolidation** and are now **breaking out**.  
- A strong 6-month momentum reading combined with a breakout from consolidation can indicate a powerful move.

In such cases, the 6-month momentum filter helps you focus on breakouts that are aligned with a strong, established trend.

## 4. Limitations and Trade-Offs of Using Filters

### 4.1. Missing Good Trades

Pradeep emphasizes an important drawback:

- Over time, he realized that using strict filters like MDT caused him to **miss some really good trades**.  
- Some excellent opportunities do not meet the 6-month momentum criteria but still produce strong moves after a 4% breakout.

### 4.2. Why Pradeep Does Not Use These Filters Now

Because of this experience:

- Pradeep **no longer personally uses** the MDT or similar filters in his own trading.  
- He found that the cost of missing good trades outweighed the benefit of having a smaller, more filtered list.

### 4.3. How You Can Still Use Them Effectively

Despite not using them himself now, Pradeep notes:

- **You can still use the MDT filter** (or similar momentum filters) if you are overwhelmed by too many breakouts.  
- These filters are useful for **reducing the number of stocks** to a manageable set of **very strong** names.  
- They can be especially helpful if you are still learning how to handle and select from a large list of breakout candidates.

## 5. Managing Overwhelm and High-Pressure Decision Making

### 5.1. Reducing the Number of Candidates

When many stocks are showing 4% breakouts:

- A filter like MDT helps you **manage the pressure** by giving you a smaller list.  
- This makes it easier to focus, analyze, and make decisions without feeling overloaded.

The idea is to balance:

- The **breadth** of opportunities (many breakouts)  
- With the **depth** of analysis you can realistically perform under time pressure.

### 5.2. Handling Many 4% Breakouts Without TC2000

Pradeep also alludes to traders who:

- Do **not have TC2000** or the exact same tools.  
- Still see many stocks showing up in their 4% breakout scans.

For such traders:

- The **concept** remains the same: use some form of **momentum or strength filter** to narrow down the list.  
- Even if you cannot use MDT specifically, you can apply similar logic with whatever tools or platforms you have to reduce the number of candidates and make the process manageable.

## 6. Summary of Key Lessons

- 4% breakout scans can produce **200–300 candidates**, which is overwhelming.  
- A **6-month momentum filter (MDT)** in TC2000 can be used to focus on stocks with strong **126-day momentum**.  
- Example threshold: around **1.18% average daily momentum over 126 days**, selecting only very strong stocks.  
- This filter is especially useful for:
  - **Longer-term holds**, and  
  - **Breakouts from long-term consolidations** with strong underlying momentum.  
- However, strict filters can cause you to **miss good trades**; this is why Pradeep **no longer uses them himself**.  
- You can still use MDT or similar filters to:
  - **Reduce the number of stocks**,  
  - Manage **overwhelm and high-pressure decisions**,  
  - And focus on the **strongest** names when you are still developing your selection and trade management skills.
