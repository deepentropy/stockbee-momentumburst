## 1. Introduction to the 4% Breakout/Breakdown Scan

The 4% breakout and 4% breakdown scans are tools to identify **momentum bursts**—stocks that are making a significant range expansion move (up or down) with strong participation. These scans are designed to find stocks that are already moving with enough magnitude and volume to have a higher probability of follow-through during the trading day.

The lesson focuses on:
- **When** to run these scans.
- **How** to interpret and trade the candidates.
- **Why** certain conditions (like V/V1 and minimum volume) are critical.
- **Common misconceptions** traders have about “getting in too late” or about early-day volume conditions.

## 2. When to Run the 4% Breakout and Breakdown Scans

### 2.1. Real-Time Data Requirements (TC2000)

- The scans are demonstrated using **TC2000**.
- If you only have **Gold membership**:
  - You have **20-minute delayed data**.
  - With delayed data, you will not see meaningful scan results for the **first 30–45 minutes** after the open.
- To see candidates **immediately at the open**, you need:
  - **Real-time add-on data** (approximately $12).
- The instructor personally uses:
  - **TC2000 Platinum plan**, which allows scans to run **immediately** as the market opens.

**Key point:** Real-time data is essential if you want to capture the early, high-quality momentum bursts that appear right after the open.

---

### 2.2. Scan Behavior at Market Open

- As soon as the market opens, the **4% breakout and 4% breakdown scans start populating**.
- The **first few minutes** after the open:
  - Stocks that show up early are often the ones that **build momentum over the day**.
  - Many stocks that go on to make **big moves** typically appear in the **first 30 minutes to 1 hour**.
  - Most of them show up in the **first half hour**.

**Behavior in a bull market:**
- On most days in a **bull market**, the majority of strong 4% breakouts will appear **early in the morning**.
- On strong days, by **30 minutes after the open**, you may see:
  - **60, 70, 80, sometimes 100 stocks** in the 4% breakout scan.

---

### 2.3. Intraday Scan Behavior (Morning vs Afternoon)

- The scan should be run **throughout the day**.
- Typical pattern:
  - **Morning:** Most of the high-quality momentum bursts appear.
  - **Afternoon:** Sometimes, especially on certain days, **strong buying can come in during the afternoon**, causing new 4% breakouts to appear later in the day.
- The instructor:
  - Runs the **4% breakout and 4% breakdown scans continuously** from the **opening print** until the close.

**Summary:**
- **Start running the scans as soon as the market opens.**
- **Continue running them all day.**
- The **first half of the day** is where the **“real money”** is typically made with this setup, but valid setups can appear at any time.

## 3. How to Trade Using the 4% Breakout Scan

### 3.1. Selecting Candidates in Real Time

- As stocks start showing up in the scan:
  - The instructor looks for the **first good setup** and is willing to buy it.
  - If the first is not ideal, he may buy the **second or third** good setup that appears.
- He acts **immediately** when a good setup appears that meets the criteria:
  - 4% breakout condition.
  - V/V1 condition.
  - Minimum volume condition (e.g., 100,000 shares).

**Time flexibility:**
- If no good candidate appears in the first 30 minutes:
  - He is still willing to buy at **11:00**, **2:00**, **3:00**, or even **3:58** if a **good setup** appears.
- The key is **quality of the setup**, not the time of day.

---

### 3.2. Capital Constraints and Trade Frequency

- In the **first half hour**, you will often see **more tradeable candidates than you have capital**.
- This means:
  - You must **select** among multiple candidates.
  - You cannot take every trade; you must prioritize the **best setups**.

**Implication:** The early part of the day can be very opportunity-rich, but you must be selective and disciplined in choosing which breakouts to trade.

## 4. Common Objections and Misunderstandings

### 4.1. “By the Time It’s Up 4%, It’s Too Late”

Many traders object that:
- “By the time a stock shows up in the 4% breakout scan, it’s already up 4–6%, or even 10–20% for low-priced stocks. Isn’t that too late?”

**Response:**
- This objection reflects a **misunderstanding of momentum bursts**.
- The **whole idea** of the 4% breakout is:
  - You are selecting stocks that have a **significant range expansion**.
  - This magnitude (4% or more) is what gives the move a **higher probability of follow-through**.
- If you try to buy the stock when it is only **1–2% up**:
  - There is **no guarantee** it will ever become a momentum burst.
  - It may not be a genuine range expansion at all.

**Key principle:**
- A **momentum burst** requires a **certain magnitude of move**.
- The fact that the stock is already up **4–6% (or more)** is **not a reason to avoid it**; it is a **reason to consider it**, because it indicates a real range expansion.

---

### 4.2. “V/V1 Condition Can’t Be Met Early in the Day”

Another common objection:
- “Your 4% breakout scan has a **V/V1 condition** (today’s volume vs yesterday’s volume), and that condition will never be met in the first half of the day.”

**Response:**
- This is **incorrect**.
- The **V/V1 condition can be met as early as 9:30**, right at the open.
- If, at the open, there are **more buyers than yesterday’s buying**, the stock can meet the V/V1 condition **immediately**.
- The instructor has traded this setup for **22 years** and has seen **stocks meet V/V1 every day**, including **first thing in the morning**.

**Key point:**
- Stocks that meet **V/V1 early** and also meet the **minimum volume condition** (e.g., 100,000 shares) are the ones that are being **strongly bought**.
- These are precisely the kinds of stocks you want for a **momentum burst** trade.

---

### 4.3. Misunderstanding Momentum, Range Expansion, and Volume

- Buying a stock that:
  - Does **not** meet the **V/V1 condition**, and
  - Does **not** meet the **100,000 volume condition**,
- Means you are buying something that:
  - **Does not have clear momentum**,
  - **Does not have strong range expansion**,
  - **Does not have volume expansion**.

The **probability of such trades working** is **much lower**.

**Root cause of objections:**
- These objections (“too late,” “V/V1 can’t be met early”) come from:
  - **Not understanding how prices move** in the market.
  - **Not understanding the mechanics** of the momentum burst setup.
- Instead of accepting the logic of the setup, traders often:
  - Try to **modify the scan** to get in “earlier,”
  - Enter trades that are **not true breakouts** and **not true momentum bursts**.

---

## 5. Practical Guidelines and Psychological Advice

### 5.1. Focus on Genuine Momentum Bursts

- The **4% breakout** is designed to capture **genuine momentum bursts**:
  - **Range expansion** of at least 4%.
  - **Volume expansion** (V/V1 and minimum volume).
- Stocks that:
  - Show up **early** in the scan,
  - Meet **V/V1** and **volume** conditions,
- Are the ones being **strongly bought** and are more likely to **trend for the rest of the day**.

**Remember:**
- Many of the best trades will:
  - Show up in the **first few minutes**.
  - Continue to **go up for the rest of the day** if the momentum is genuine.

---

### 5.2. Avoid Premature Entries and Scan Modifications

- Trying to:
  - Get in **before** the 4% breakout,
  - Or **loosening** the conditions (e.g., ignoring V/V1 or volume),
- Leads to:
  - Entering trades that **lack true momentum**.
  - Lower probability setups.
- Do **not**:
  - Modify the scan just to catch “early” moves that **haven’t proven themselves** as momentum bursts.

**Guideline:**
- Let the **setup prove itself**:
  - Wait for the **4% breakout**.
  - Ensure **V/V1** and **volume** conditions are met.
- Trade **proven momentum**, not **hopeful anticipation**.

---

### 5.3. Importance of Deep Study of the Setup

- The instructor emphasizes:
  - Many objections and mistakes come from **superficial understanding**.
- He advises:
  - Spend time doing **deep dives** into:
    - How **prices move**.
    - How **momentum bursts** behave.
    - The **mechanics** of the 4% breakout setup.
- Before:
  - Modifying scans.
  - Entering trades that are **not even breaking out**.

**Psychological takeaway:**
- Be **patient** and **disciplined**.
- Respect the **rules of the setup**.
- Do the **work to understand** why each condition exists, instead of trying to shortcut the process.

---

**Core Summary:**

- **Run 4% breakout and breakdown scans from the market open and throughout the day.**
- **Use real-time data** (e.g., TC2000 with real-time add-on or Platinum) to capture early opportunities.
- The **first half hour to one hour** is typically where the **best momentum bursts** appear, but valid setups can occur at any time.
- Do **not fear buying stocks already up 4–6% (or more)**; that magnitude is what defines a momentum burst.
- The **V/V1 and volume conditions can and do get met early** and are essential to identify **strongly bought** stocks.
- Avoid **premature entries** and **scan modifications** that dilute the setup; instead, **study and understand** the mechanics of momentum bursts before changing anything.
