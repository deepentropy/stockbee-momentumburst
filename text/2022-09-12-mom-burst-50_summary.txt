## 1. Overview of the 4% Breakout Method

The lesson focuses on applying filters to a **4% breakout trading method**. The core idea is to scan for stocks that break out by around 4%, then select trades from those breakout candidates. The emphasis here is not on the breakout rules themselves, but on **how to filter the universe of stocks** to make the method more manageable and aligned with a trader’s time, risk, and style.

## 2. Using Filters to Reduce Trading Complexity

### 2.1. The Default Broad Universe

In the example shown (using TC2000), the breakout scan is initially run on a **very broad universe**, including:

- U.S. common stocks  
- American Depository Receipts (ADRs)  
- Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

This broad setup can cover **6,000 to 9,000+ symbols** when you include all these categories.

### 2.2. Problems with a Very Wide Universe

Running the 4% breakout scan on such a large universe:

- Produces **many breakout candidates**  
- Increases **complexity and workload**  
- Requires **active, dynamic management** of positions

This is more suitable for traders who:

- Have time to monitor markets closely  
- Are comfortable handling many signals and smaller-cap names  

For traders who are busy or prefer slower, simpler trading, this wide universe can be overwhelming.

## 3. Index-Based Filtering Strategy

### 3.1. When Index Filtering Is Appropriate

Index filtering is recommended for traders who:

- Are **working full-time** or otherwise very busy  
- **Cannot actively monitor** breakouts and manage positions dynamically  
- Prefer **slower-paced trading**  
- Want to **avoid very small stocks** and focus on larger, more established names  

For such traders, narrowing the universe is a practical way to keep the 4% breakout method manageable.

### 3.2. How to Apply Index Filters in Practice

Instead of scanning all U.S. stocks, ADRs, and ETFs, you:

1. **Remove** the broad categories (U.S. common stocks, ADRs, ETFs) from the scan universe.  
2. **Add only index components** as your scan universe, specifically:
   - NASDAQ 100  
   - S&P 500  
   - (Optionally) Dow Jones 30  

Note:

- Adding the Dow Jones 30 is not strictly necessary, because **every Dow 30 component is already part of the S&P 500**.  
- The key is that your breakout scan now runs **only on these index components**, not on the entire market.

### 3.3. Impact of Index Filtering on Trade Frequency and Stock Type

Using index components as a filter has clear effects:

- **Fewer ideas**:  
  - The filter is **very restrictive**, so the number of breakout candidates drops significantly.  
- **Larger-cap focus**:  
  - You will mostly see **larger-cap stocks**, since NASDAQ 100 and S&P 500 are large-cap indices.  
- **Simpler management**:  
  - With fewer signals and more liquid, well-known names, the method becomes easier to manage for busy traders.

This approach trades off **quantity and potential explosiveness** of small caps for **simplicity and stability** of large caps.

## 4. Trade-Offs: Big Returns vs. Simplicity and Time Constraints

- If you want **absolutely big returns**, you generally need to trade **smaller stocks**, which:
  - Often move more dramatically  
  - Require more active monitoring and management  

- If you:
  - Have limited time  
  - Prefer slower trading  
  - Want to avoid the complexity of many small, volatile names  

  then **index-based filtering** is more suitable, even though:
  - You will get **fewer trades**  
  - You may sacrifice some of the very large return potential found in smaller stocks  

The choice depends on your **time availability, risk tolerance, and desired trading pace**.

## 5. Practical Summary and Key Takeaways

- The **4% breakout method** can generate many signals when run on a broad universe (U.S. stocks, ADRs, ETFs).  
- To **reduce complexity**, especially for busy or working traders, use **filters**.  
- A practical and effective filter is to **limit the scan universe to index components**:
  - NASDAQ 100  
  - S&P 500  
  - (Optional) Dow Jones 30, though its components are already in the S&P 500.  
- This **index filtering**:
  - Produces **very few, higher-quality, large-cap ideas**  
  - Makes the method more manageable  
  - Is well-suited for traders who want **slower, simpler trading** and **larger-cap exposure**  
- For **maximum return potential**, you would instead focus on **smaller stocks**, but that requires more time and active management.

This lesson’s core message:  
Use **index-based filters** on your 4% breakout scan if you are busy, prefer larger-cap stocks, and want to simplify your trading process.
